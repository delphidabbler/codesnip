<h1>
  CodeSnip Build Instructions
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  <em>CodeSnip</em> is written in Object Pascal and is targeted at Delphi
  2010. It requires some language features introduced in this version so will
  not compile with any earlier compilers. The code <em>may</em> compile with
  Delphi XE or as a 32 bit application on Delphi XE2 or later but neither have
  been tested.
</p>

<p>
  The Delphi 2010 IDE can be used to modify the source and to perform test
  builds. Final builds should be built using the provided makefile, but you
  can get away with using the IDE if you don't change any resources or the
  type library.
</p>

<p>
  <em>If you want to compile with an earlier Delphi, </em>CodeSnip<em> was
  compatible with Delphi 2006 and later up to and including v3.5.4. You could
  fetch the source for an earlier version from the repository. If you do this
  you should refer to the version of this file that accompanied the chosen
  version.</em>
</p>

<h2>
  Dependencies
</h2>

<p>
  Several DelphiDabbler and other 3rd party libraries and components are
    required to compile <em>CodeSnip</em>, most of which are included in the
  code repository in the <code>Src/3rdParty</code> directory. Code not
  included in the repository is noted below.
</p>

<h3>
  Indy libraries v10
</h3>

<p>
  The Indy 10 Internet components ship with Delphi 2010.
  If you prefer to work with the latest release you can download it from <a
    href="http://www.indyproject.org/"
  >http://www.indyproject.org/</a>. If you download a copy of Indy 10 you
  should compile the source code separately with the same version of Delphi
  that is being used to compile <em>CodeSnip</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Regardless of whether you are using the version of Indy 10 supplied with
  Delphi or if you have downloaded and compiled your own version, you must set
  the <code>INDY10</code> environment variable to the directory where you
  placed the compiled code.
</p>

<h4 id="indychanges">
  Changes between different Indy 10 releases
</h4>

<p>
  Changes were made to the parameter lists of the <var>TWorkBeginEvent</var>
  and <var>TWorkEvent</var> events between early and later releases of Indy
  10. Specifically, earlier versions use type <var>Integer</var> for the
  <var>AWorkCount</var> parameter of <var>TWorkEvent</var> and the
  <var>AWorkCountMax</var> parameter of <var>TWorkBeginEvent</var>, while
  later versions use <var>Int64</var>.
<p>

<p>
  <em>CodeSnip</em>'s source code uses conditional compilation to provide the
  correct event handler signatures &ndash; and it makes an intelligent guess
  at which signature to use depending on the version number provided by the
  Indy library code. Should the program fail to compile with an error in the
  <var>UDownloadMonitor</var> unit, you should check the event signatures in
  your Indy <var>IdComponent</var> unit and then define the
  <code>INDY_WORKEVENT_INT64</code> environment variable if <var>Int64</var>
  parameters are required or <code>INDY_WORKEVENT_INT32</code> if
  <var>Integer</var> parameters are used.
</p>

<h3>
  Delphi RTL &amp; VCL
</h3>

<p>
  Goes without saying really, but you need the RTL and VCL that ships with
  Delphi.
</p>

<h2>
  Build Tools
</h2>

<p>
  The following tools are required to build <em>CodeSnip</em>.
</p>

<h3>
  Delphi
</h3>

<p>
  A copy of the Delphi 2010 command line compiler is required to build the
  object Pascal code from the provided makefile.
</p>

<p>
  You can use the Delphi IDE to edit the code and test compile it, but final
  builds should be created using the makefile, which requires the following
  tools that are supplied with Delphi:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>DCC32</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The Delphi command line compiler.
  </dd>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>BRCC32</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The Borland resource compiler. Used to compile various resource source
    (<code>.rc</code>) files.
  </dd>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>TLibImpl</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Type library importer tool. Used to create a Pascal unit that describes
    code contained in <code>ExternalObj.idl</code>.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  The following environment variables are associated with these tools:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>DELPHIROOT</code> - required unless <code>DELPHI2010</code> is
        set.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Should be set to the install directory of the version of Delphi being
    used. <code>DCC32</code>, <code>BRCC32</code> and <code>TLibImpl</code>
    are expected to be in the <code>Bin</code> sub-directory of
    <code>DELPHIROOT</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>DELPHI2010</code> - optional
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This environment variable can be set to the Delphi 2010 install
    directory. When <code>DELPHI2010</code> is defined
    <code>DELPHIROOT</code> will be set to the value of
    <code>DELPHI2010</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>INDY10</code> - required
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Must be set to the directory where the Indy 10 components are installed.
    The code must have been built with the same version of Delphi used to
    compile <em>CodeSnip</em>.
  </dd>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>INDY_WORKEVENT_INT64</code> <strong>or</strong>
    <code>INDY_WORKEVENT_INT32</code> - optional
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <a href="#indychanges">See above</a> for details. If used, only one of
    the environment variables may be defined. Defining both causes
    compilation to fail.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>
  Borland MAKE
</h3>

<p>
  This is the make tool that ships with Delphi. You can use any version that
  works.
</p>

<h3 id="mssdk">
  Microsoft Software Development Kit
</h3>

<p>
  The MIDL IDL compiler that ships with the MS SDK is required to build
  <code>ExternalObj.tlb</code> from <code>ExternalObj.idl</code>.
</p>

<p>
  MIDL requires the use of Microsoft's <code>CL.exe</code> C Pre-processor
  which in turn requires <code>mspdb**.dll</code>, where ** is a number that
  depends on the version of Visual Studio used. I use MIDL v7 and
  <code>mspdb80.dll</code> from the Windows 2008 (v6.1) platform SDK. So that
  MIDL can find these files you need to update your system PATH to include:
</p>

<ul class="spaced">
  <li>
    The path to <code>CL.exe</code>. This will probably be in a sub folder
    of a MS Visual Studio installation folder. For example
    <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Common Visual studio binary directory where <code>mspdb**.dll</code>
    is located. For example
    <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The <code>MSSDK</code> environment variable must be set and contain the
  MS SDK install directory. <code>MIDL.exe</code> must be in the
  <code>Bin</code> sub-directory of <code>MSSDK</code> and the required
  include files must be in the <code>Include</code> sub-directory.
</p>

<p>
  You can use a batch file with contents similar to the following to set the
  path and the <code>MSSDK</code> environment variable before building
  <em>CodeSnip</em>:
</p>

<pre class="indent">if not "%PATHSET%" == "" goto end
set MSSDK=C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE
set PATHSET=1
:end</pre>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> You do not need a copy of Visual Studio for this
  &ndash; the required directories and files are created when the SDK is
  installed.
</p>

<h4>
  Build Without MIDL or the MS SDK
</h4>

<p>
  If you don't already have the MS SDK it's a big job to download and install
  it just to compile one <code>.tlb</code> file. Therefore there's an
  alternative that means you can compile without the SDK. This is described
  in the section
  <a
    href="#nomidl"
  >Editing and Compiling Without MIDL</a> below.
</p>

<p>
  If you take this route, there's no need to set <code>MSSDK</code> or modify
  the path.
</p>

<h3>
  DelphiDabbler Version Information Editor (VIEd)
</h3>

<p>
  This tool is used to compile version information (<code>.vi</code>) files
  into intermediate resource source (<code>.rc</code>) files. Version 2.11.2
  or later is required.
  Version Information Editor can be obtained from
  <a
    href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/vied"
  >http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/vied</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>VIEDROOT</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h3>
  DelphiDabbler HTML Resource Compiler (HTMLRes)
</h3>

<p>
  HTMLRes is used to compile <code>HTML.hrc</code> which stores various
  HTML, JavaScript, CSS and images into HTML resources. Version 1.1 or later
  is required.
  The HTML Resource Compiler can be obtained from
  <a
    href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/htmlres"
  >http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/htmlres</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>HTMLRESROOT</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h3>
  Inno Setup
</h3>

<p>
  The Unicode version on the Inno setup command line compiler is needed to
  create <em>CodeSnip</em>'s install program. v5.5.2 (u) or later is required.
  Earlier (Unicode) versions may work, but this is not guaranteed.
</p>

<p>
  You can get Inno Setup at <a
    href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php"
  >http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php</a>. Choose the Unicode version and
  ensure that the ISPP pre-processor is installed. If you already have the ANSI
  version the Unicode version can be installed alongside it - just use a
  different install directory and program group name.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>INNOSETUP</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h3>
  Microsoft HTML Help Compiler (HHC)
</h3>

<p>
  This command line compiler is supplied with Microsoft HTML Help Workshop. It
  is used to compile the <em>CodeSnip</em> help file.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>HHCROOT</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h3>
  Zip
</h3>

<p>
  This program is used to create <em>CodeSnip</em>'s release file.
  You can get a Windows command line version at
  <a
    href="http://stahlforce.com/dev/index.php?tool=zipunzip"
  >http://stahlforce.com/dev/index.php?tool=zipunzip</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>ZIPROOT</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h2>
  Preparation
</h2>

<h3>
  Configure the environment.
</h3>

<p>
  You can configure environment variables either by modifying your system
  environment variables or by creating a batch file that you run before
  performing the build.
</p>

<h4>
  Step 1
</h4>

<p>
  Configure the required environment variables. Compilation will fail if these
  environment variables are not set:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>DELPHIROOT</code> <strong>or</strong> <code>DELPHI2010</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>INDY10</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>MSSDK</code> (if using MIDL - see step 2)
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>
  Step 2
</h4>

<p>
  Update the <code>PATH</code> environment variable to include the paths that
  MIDL needs (explained <a
    href="#mssdk"
  >above</a>).
</p>

<p>
  If you are not using MIDL then there is no need to modify the
  <code>PATH</code> variable or set <code>MSSDK</code>. Instead you can
  define <code>IGNOREMIDL</code> by setting it to some value, e.g.
  <code>set IGNOREMIDL=1</code>.
</p>

<h4>
  Step 3
</h4>

<p>
  Set any of the following environment variables that are needed to specify
  the path to any tools that cannot be found on the path:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>VIEDROOT</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>HTMLRESROOT</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>INNOSETUP</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>HHCROOT</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>ZIPROOT</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>
  Step 4
</h4>

<p>
  Set <code>INDY_WORKEVENT_INT64</code> or <code>INDY_WORKEVENT_INT32</code>
  if necessary (explained <a
    href="#indychanges"
  >above</a>).
</p>

<h3>
  Get the Source Code
</h3>

<p>
  If you don't already have it, download or checkout the <em>CodeSnip</em>
  source code. There are several options:
</p>

<ol class="spaced">
  <li>
    <div>
      If you are a Subversion user you can:
    </div>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        <div>
          Check out the source using the following command:
        </div>
        <pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> svn checkout http://codesnip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ PATH</pre>
        <div>
          Where <code>PATH</code> is the directory where you want to place the
          working copy. You will not be able to commit changes unless you join
          the project, when a different check out URL is used.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          Export the code using this command:
        </div>
        <pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> svn export http://codesnip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ PATH</pre>
        <div>
          where <code>PATH</code> is the directory where you wish to store the
          code.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="spaced">
      These commands get code from the repository trunk. To get the code of a
      stable release replace <code>trunk</code> with <code>tags/XXXX</code>
      where <code>XXX</code> specifies the version.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Download source files for the current many older releases from the <a
      href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/codesnip/files/"
    >CodeSnip SourceForge Files Page</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Grab the source code of the latest release from <a
      href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/codesnip/download"
    >DelphiDabbler.com</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
  Configure the Source Tree
</h3>

<p>
  After checking out or downloading and extracting the source code you should
  have the following directory structure:
</p>

<pre>./
  |
  +-- Docs                  - documentation
  |   |
  |   +-- Design            - documents concerning design
  |
  +-- Src                   - main CodeSnip source code
      |
      +-- 3rdParty          - third party &amp; DelphiDabbler library source code
      |
      +-- AutoGen           - receives automatically generated code
      |
      +-- Help              - help source files
      |   |
      |   +-- CSS           - CSS code for help files
      |   |
      |   +-- HTML          - HTML files included in help file
      |   |
      |   +-- Images        - images included in help file
      |
      +-- Install           - setup script and support code
      |
      +-- InstallHelper     - source for install helper program
      |   |
      |   +-- Res           - resources for install helper program
      |
      +-- Res               - container for various types of resources
          |
          +-- HTML          - html, css, js and images included in resources
          |
          +-- Img           - images included in resources
          |
          +-- Misc          - other resources</pre>

<p>
  If, by chance you also have a <code>Bin</code>, <code>Exe</code> and
  <code>Release</code> directory don't worry - all will become clear.
  Subversion users may also see the usual <code>.svn</code> hidden
  directories. If you have done some editing you may also see occasional
  hidden <code>__history</code> folders.
</p>

<p>
  Before you can get hacking, you need to prepare the code tree. Open a
  command console and navigate into the <code>Src</code> sub-folder. Run any
  script you have created to set the required environment variables then do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make config</pre>

<p>
  You may need to replace <code>Make</code> with the full path to
  <code>Make</code> if it isn't on the path, or if the <code>Make</code> that
  runs isn't the Borland / CodeGear version. If this is the case try:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> %DELPHIROOT%\Bin\Make config</pre>

<p>
  or
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> %DELPHI2010%\Bin\Make config</pre>

<p>
  depending on which environment variable you have set.
</p>

<p>
  Once <code>Make config</code> has completed your folder structure should
  have acquired the following new folders:
</p>

<pre>./
  |
  +-- Bin                   - receives object files for CodeSnip
  |   |
  |   +-- InstallHelper     - receives object files for CSSetupHelper
  |
  ...
  |
  +-- Exe                   - receives executable code and compiled help file
  |
  +-- Release               - receives release files
  |
  ...</pre>

<p>
  If the <code>Bin</code>, <code>Exe</code> and <code>Release</code> folders
  already existed they will have been emptied.
  In addition, <code>Make</code> will have created <code>.cfg</code> files from
  templates in the <code>Src</code> and <code>Src\InstallHelper</code> folders.
  <code>.cfg</code> files are needed for DCC32 to run correctly. These files
  will be ignored by Subversion.
</p>

<p>
  If you are intending to use the Delphi IDE to compile code, you should also
  do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make resources
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make typelib
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make autogen</pre>

<p>
  This compiles the resource files that the IDE needs to link into compiled
  executables, compiles the type library from IDL code and generates the
  Pascal file that provides an interface to the type library.
</p>

<p>
  You are now ready to build the source. If you want to modify the source
  now's the time to do it.
</p>

<h3 id="nomidl">
  Editing and Compiling without MIDL
</h3>

<p>
  If you don't have the MIDL compiler you need to get hold of a pre-compiled
  copy of the <code>ExternalObj.tlb</code> type library and tell Make to skip
  the MIDL compiling stage.
</p>

<h4>
  Getting The Type Library
</h4>

<ol class="spaced">
  <li>
    If necessary download a resource file editor. XN Resource Editor will
    do the job. You can get that from
    <a
      href="http://www.wilsonc.demon.co.uk/d10resourceeditor.htm"
    >http://www.wilsonc.demon.co.uk/d10resourceeditor.htm</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get a suitable copy of the <em>CodeSnip</em> executable. This must have
    been compiled from the same version of <code>ExternalObj.idl</code> as
    that included in the source tree.
  </li>
  <li>
    Load <code>CodeSnip.exe</code> into the resource file editor (Use
    <em>File | Open</em> in XN Resource Editor). You need to
    find the TYPELIB resource type. There should only be one, language
    neutral, TYPELIB resource. Select this and export it as
    <code>ExternalObj.tlb</code> in the <code>Bin</code> folder in your
    configured source tree. (Use <em>Resource | Export</em> Resource in XN
    Resource Editor).
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  If you are working on the latest development tree from the code repository
  you should get <code>ExternalObj.tlb</code> from the latest release of
  <em>CodeSnip</em>, <strong>unless</strong> <code>ExternalObj.idl</code>
  has been changed since the last release. In this case you
  <strong>must</strong> use MIDL to build the <code>.idl</code> file, because
  a suitable <code>.tlb</code> file won't be available.
</p>

<h4>
  Editing the Type Library
</h4>

<p>
  You can edit the type library from the Delphi IDE. Start the IDE, select
  File | Open, change the file type to Type Library and navigate to
  <code>ExternalObj.tlb</code>. This opens the type library. Edit as required
  then save the changes. Delete any <code>*_TLB</code> files that appear.
</p>

<p>
  If you do make changes you should also use the type library editor's
  <em>Export to IDL</em> button to save a copy of the IDL in
  <code>ExternalObj.idl</code> in the <code>Src</code> folder. The license in
  the original code must be restored and you can add yourself as a
  contributor, so take a copy of the license from <code>ExternalObj.idl</code>
  before saving!
</p>

<p>
  You must regenerate the associated Pascal file. Do this by running:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make autogen</pre>

<h4>
  Telling Make to Ignore MIDL
</h4>

<p>
  You now need to prevent Make from trying to compile the <code>.idl</code>
  file in the absence of MIDL. Do this by defining an environment variable
  called <code>IGNOREMIDL</code>. This can be done from the command line or
  a batch file by doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd">
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> set IGNOREMIDL=1</pre>

<p>
  Alternatively, call Make with the <code>-DIGNOREMIDL</code> switch.
</p>

<h2>
  Building CodeSnip
</h2>

<p>
  You have several options:
</p>

<p>
  Each of these options is described below. All except the last assume that
  <code>Make config</code> has been run.
</p>

<h3>
  Build the CodeSnip Executable
</h3>

<p>
  This is the most common build and has a simple command:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make codesnip</pre>

<p>
  This is the same as doing this sequence of commands:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make typelib
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make resources
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make autogen
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make pascal</pre>

<p>
  The <em>CodeSnip</em> executable will be placed in the <code>Exe</code>
  folder.
</p>

<p>
  If you are building without MIDL, and have a suitable copy of
  <code>ExternalObj.tlb</code> already in the <code>Bin</code> directory you
  must either have defined the <code>IGNOREMIDL</code> environment variable or
  you must do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make -DIGNOREMIDL codesnip</pre>

<p>
  This is the same as doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make -DIGNOREMIDL typelib
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make resources
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make autogen
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make pascal</pre>

<h3>
  Build the Help File
</h3>

<p>
  To build the help file just do
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make help</pre>

<h3>
  Build the Setup Program
</h3>

<p>
  The setup program requires that the <em>CodeSnip</em> excutable and the
  compiled help file are already present in the <code>Exe</code> directory.
  <code>CSInstallHelper.exe</code> must also be present in the same folder.
</p>

<p>
  We've already shown how to build <em>CodeSnip</em> and the help file.
  <code>CSInstallHelper.exe</code> is built by doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make installhelper</pre>

<p>
  As an aside, you can make all the required files by doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make exes</pre>

<p>
  <code>Make exes</code> will require the use of the <code>-DIGNOREMIDL</code>
  switch if MIDL is not available.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have built all the required files you build the setup file by
  doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make setup</pre>

<p>
  The setup program is named <code>CodeSnip-Setup-x.x.x.exe</code>, where
  x.x.x is the version number extracted from <em>CodeSnip</em>'s version
  information. It is placed in the <code>Exe</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
  If the <em>SpecialBuild</em> string is defined in <em>CodeSnip</em>'s
  version information the string will be appended to the setup file name like
  this <code>CodeSnip-Setup-x.x.x-SPECIALBUILD</code>.
</p>

<h3>
  Build the Release Zip File
</h3>

<p>
  Once the setup file has been compiled you can create a zip file containing
  the setup file along with <code>ReadMe.txt</code> from the <code>Docs</code>
  directory. If either file is missing the build fails. Build the release by
  doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make release</pre>

<p>
  By default the release file is called <code>dd-codesnip.zip</code>. You can
  change this name by defining the <code>RELEASEFILENAME</code> macro or
  enviroment variable. For example, you can name the file
  <code>MyRelease.zip</code> by doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make -DRELEASEFILENAME=MyRelease.zip release</pre>

<h3>
  Build and Release Everything
</h3>

<p>
  You can do a clean build of everything, and generate the release zip file
  simply by doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make</pre>

<p>
  without specifying a target. This is the equivalent of:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make config
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make exes
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make setup
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make release</pre>

<p>
  <strong>Warning:</strong> You should not run this command if MIDL is not
  available since <code>Make config</code> will delete any <code>.tlb</code>
  file you may have placed in the <code>Bin</code> directory.
</p>

<h3>
  Clean Up
</h3>

<p>
  Various temporary files and directories are created by the IDE. These can be
  deleted by running.
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make clean</pre>

<p>
  Be warned though that this command removes the <code>__history</code>
  folders that Delphi uses to maintain earlier versions of files.
