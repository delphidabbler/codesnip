Licensing of CodeSnip's source and image files is on a per file basis.

There are two ways that license information can be found:

1) By examining comments within source files. License information will be at or
   near the beginning of the file. Such comments take precedence over any
   LICENSE file.

2) By reading any LICENSE file that exists in the same directory as the files
   you are interested in, or if no such file exists, in a parent directory.
   The "nearest" LICENSE file takes precedence.

   A LICENSE file is used to provide license information for source files that
   have no (or unclear) embedded information and for images and other files that
   do not have human-readable content.

If any information is missing or incorrect please inform the author by filing
a bug report at https://github.com/delphidabbler/codesnip/issues

If you are planning on re-using any of the CodeSnip source, detailed licensing
information will be found in Docs/License.html.
