      Have I The Right To Submit a Snippet?
    </h1>
    <p>
      <strong>This topic is for guidance only and is not authoritative. To be
      sure you have the rights to submit a snippet contact the initial author or
      read any license that accompanied the snippet.</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you wrote the snippet you have the right to do as you like with it.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you acquired the snippet from a blog post or similar, check the
        posting to see if the author has placed any restrictions on use. It is
        unusual for the author to assert any rights over code snippets, but they
        may do.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a snippet is in the public domain you can submit it and it is OK to
        license it under the <a
          class="weblink"
          target="_blank"
          href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"
        >MIT License</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you extracted a snippet from anyone's licensed source code then you
        need to check the license to see if it allows the code to be distributed
        and re-licensed.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the author simply requires credit for his or her work included their
        name in the comments when you submit the snippet and make it clear they
        need to be credited. Note though that any requirement to reproduce a
        copyright statement cannot be met: snippets the Code Snippets database
        are released under the copyright of Peter Johnson and
        &quot;contributors&quot;. Contributors to the database can be viewed in
