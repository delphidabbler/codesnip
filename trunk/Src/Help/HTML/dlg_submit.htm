    <p>
      This wizard is used to submit user defined snippets for inclusion in the
      online Code Snippets database. It is accessed <em>Snippets | Submit
      Snippets</em> menu item. The menu item is only available if there are user
      defined snippets in the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various pages of the wizard are discussed below. You can cancel your
      submission at any time the <em>Cancel</em> button is enabled.
    </p>
    <h2>
      First page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is simply an introductory page that describes the wizard. Click the
      <em>Next</em> button to display the <em>Select Snippets</em> page and to
      begin using the wizard.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;Select Snippets&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page displays a check list of all the user-defined snippets in the
      database. It is used to select the snippets you wish to submit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check the names of the required snippets. Checking a category selects all
      the snippets in the category. At least one snippet must be checked before
      moving on to the next page. If a user-defined snippet was displayed in the
      main window when the wizard was started, that snippet will be pre-selected
      in the check list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the <em>Next</em> button to move the next page. If no snippets are
      selected an error message is displayed.
    </p>
    <h2>

    </h2>
