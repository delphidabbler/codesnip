    </h1>
    <p>
      This wizard is used to submit user defined snippets for inclusion in the
      online Code Snippets database. It is accessed <em>Snippets | Submit
      Snippets</em> menu item. The menu item is only available if there are user
      defined snippets in the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various pages of the wizard are discussed below. You can cancel your
      submission at any time the <em>Cancel</em> button is enabled.
    </p>
    <h2>
      First page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is simply an introductory page that describes the wizard. Click the
      <em>Next</em> button to display the <em>Select Snippets</em> page and to
      begin using the wizard.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;Select Snippets&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page displays a check list of all the user-defined snippets in the
      database. It is used to select the snippets you wish to submit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check the names of the required snippets. Checking a category selects all
      the snippets in the category. At least one snippet must be checked before
      moving on to the next page. If a user-defined snippet was displayed in the
      main window when the wizard was started, that snippet will be pre-selected
      in the check list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the <em>Next</em> button to move the next page. If no snippets are
      selected an error message is displayed.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;About You&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      In order to credit you, and to contact you about any problems, your name
      and email address are needed. They must be entered on this page in the
      <em>Name</em> and <em>Email Address</em> text boxes. You can
      also enter any comments or a message on the page using the optional
      <em>Your Comments</em> text box.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have successfully submitted code before <em>CodeSnip</em> will
      remember the name and email address you last used and will have entered
      them in the appropriate text boxes. Please check these are correct and
      alter as necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot move to the next page until your name and a valid email address
      are provided. Once the data has been entered click the <em>Next</em>
      button to move to the next page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> your personal data will not be abused and your
      email address will not be published. See the
      <a href="privacy_statement.htm">privacy statement</a> for more
      information.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;Ready to Submit&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      You have now provided all the required information. The only additional
      information that gets sent is the program&#39;s version number. If you
      want to see the data that will be submitted (in XML format) click the
      <em>Preview Data</em> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now ensure you are connected to the internet and click the <em>Submit</em>
      button to send the data to the <em>DelphiDabbler</em> website.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the data is sent successfully the final page of the wizard will be
      displayed. If there was an error in sending the data an error message will
      be displayed and the current page will remain.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;Submission Complete&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page is displayed when the subscription succeeds &ndash; i.e. the
      information has been sent to the <em>DelphiDabbler</em> website. The code
      does not immediately appear on the database &ndash; it will be reviewed,
      tested and revised as necessary before publication. You will be emailed if
      there are any queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the <em>Finish</em> button to close the wizard.
