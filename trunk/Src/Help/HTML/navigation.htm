    <p>
      The database is navigated in one of several ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        By clicking on a snippet name in the
        <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a>. This displays the snippet
        in the <a href="detail_pane.htm">Detail Pane</a>. Pressing and holding
        the Control key while clicking displays the snippet in a new tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        By clicking a section heading in the
        <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a>. This displays a list of
        snippets in the <a href="detail_pane.htm">Detail Pane</a>. Clicking the
        name of any snippet in the list displays it. Pressing and holding the
        Control key while selecting a category displays its contents in a new
        tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking links to snippets in a &quot;See also&quot; and &quot;Required
        snippets&quot; list in a snippet's detailed display.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using the
        <img alt="Previous button" src="../images/GoBack.gif" class="glyph">
        <em>Previous</em> and
        <img alt="Next button" src="../images/GoForward.gif" class="glyph">
        <em>Next</em> toolbar buttons or equivalent
        <a href="menu_view.htm">View menu</a> items to move backwards and
        forwards through recently visited pages. You can use the drop-down
        lists next to the buttons to jump directly to pages.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can narrow down the range of displayed routines by performing a
      <a href="task_search.htm">Search</a>.
