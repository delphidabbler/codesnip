      Move User Database Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p class="bordered">
      <strong>Note:</strong> This dialogue box is not available in the portable
      edition of <em>CodeSnip</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this dialogue box is to enable the user to move the user
      defined snippets database from its default location to a new directory.
      You may wish to do this to enable the database to be easily backed up.
      For example you could move the database to a sub-directory of a
      <em>Dropbox</em> or <em>GoogleDrive</em> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="bordered">
      <strong>Important:</strong> You a strongly advised to make a backup of the
      user defined snippets database before moving it so that it can be easily
      restored if there is a problem. Use the <em>Database | Backup User
      Database</em> menu option to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      To move the database enter the full path of the new directory in the
      <em>New database path</em> edit box. Alternatively you can use a standard
      <em>Browser For Folder</em> dialogue box to select the required directory.
      To do that click the ellipsis button to the right of the edit control,
      select the directory in the resultant dialogue box and click <em>OK</em>.
      The chosen directory will be displayed in the edit box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The directory where the database is to be copied <strong>must be
      empty</strong> and must be on a valid drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a suitable path has been entered click the large <em>Move
      Database</em> button. You will be prompted to confirm this action and then
      the database files will be copied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new location of the database will be recorded in the per user config
      file and it is important that this file is not modified or deleted
      otherwise the database will not be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      The database can be moved back to its default location by clicking the
      <em>Restore Default Path</em> button. This copies the default directory
      into the <em>New database path</em> edit control. Clicking the <em>Move
      Database</em> button will now move the database back to its default
      directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the <em>Move Database</em> button will be disabled if the
      directory entered in the <em>New database path</em> edit control is the
      current database path or if the edit control is empty.
