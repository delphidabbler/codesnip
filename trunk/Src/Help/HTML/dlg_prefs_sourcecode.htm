    <p>
      Descriptions of snippets can be included as comments in generated source
      code. The placing of such comments can be customised using the
      <em>Commenting style</em> drop down list. Options are:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        <em>No descriptive comments</em> &ndash; descriptions are not included.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Comments after snippet header</em> &ndash; comments appear between
        a snippet's header and the body of the snippet. For functions and
        procedures the header is the function or procedure prototype. For
        types and constants the comment is placed after the
        <strong>type</strong> or <strong>const</strong> keyword and before any
        other code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Comments before snippet</em> &ndash; comments are placed before the
        snippet. The snippet's name is included in the comment.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Descriptive comments are not applicable to
      <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">freeform</a> snippets.
    <p>
      A preview of the comment style is displayed below the drop down list.
    </p>
    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>
      The default format of output files is configurable. The available output
      types are HTML, rich text and two types of unformatted text, i.e. Pascal
      files and plain text files. You choose the default output type using the
      <em>Output file type</em> drop down list.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML and rich text file types can be syntax highlighted. To enable this
      option check the <em>Enable syntax highlighting</em> check box. The
      highlighting can be customised using the
      <a href="dlg_prefs_hiliter.htm">Syntax Highlighter</a> tab.
