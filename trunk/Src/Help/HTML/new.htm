    <h1>
      What's New in CodeSnip 4
    </h1>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> v4 is a substantial update over previous versions.
      Here is a list of key new features of this version.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Database Changes
    </h2>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        New &quot;<a href="snippet_unit.htm">unit</a>&quot; and
        &quot;<a href="snippet_class.htm">class</a>&quot; snippet kinds that can
        include complete units and classes (and advanced records) in the
        database. Both can be test compiled and classes / advanced records can
        also be included in generated units.
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          Snippets from both the main and user databases can now be duplicated
          using the <em>Snippets | Duplicate Snippet</em> menu option or
          <img src="..\Images\DuplicateSnippet.gif" class="glyph"> tool button.
        </div>
        <div>
          This is very useful if you have created a snippet and want to create
          another one that shares a lot of the source code, dependencies etc.
          Just duplicate the first one with a new name and edit it as required.
          It saves a lot of time.
        <div>
          There's a second use where you can duplicate a snippet from the main
          database under the same name and make any tweaks you like to the new
          version: duplicate snippets are always editable.
        </div>
        <div>
          Use the <em>Snippets | Duplicate Snippet</em> menu option, press
          <span class="smallcaps">Shift+Ctrl+D</span> or click the
          <img src="..\Images\DuplicateSnippet.gif" class="glyph"> tool button.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        The Database now supports Unicode text for snippet names, descriptions
        etc., and for source code. Using Unicode for snippet names and source
        code will mean that the code will not compile on older compilers that
        don't understand Unicode source code or unit file names.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is now finer control over the control of warnings in generated
        code via the <code>$WARN</code> directive. This is controlled on the
        <a href="dlg_prefs_codegen.htm">Code Generation</a> tab of the
        <a href="dlg_preferences.htm">Preferences</a> dialogue box.
      </li>
      <li>
        The names of referenced units may now contain dots so that Delphi
        namespaces can be used.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      User Interface
    </h2>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        The new multi-tab display can display details of more than one snippet,
        category etc. in the main display. <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl</span>
        click items in the overview pane, or links in the details pane, to
        display them in a new tab. See the <a href="detail_pane.htm">Detail
        Pane</a> help topic for more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        The main menu has been re-organised and there are new menu and toolbar
        glyphs.
      </li>
      <li>
        The structure of snippet pages in the details pane is now customisable:
        various page elements can be omitted and the order of elements can be
        changed. Each snippet type has its own page customisation. Use the
        <a href="dlg_prefs_snippetlayout.htm">Snippet Layout</a> tab of the
        <a href="dlg_preferences.htm">Preferences</a> dialogue box to do the
        customisation.
      </li>
      <li>
        The number of compilers that appear in the compile results table in the
        details pane can now be limited. Use the <em>Compiler</em> tab of the
        <a href="dlg_configcompilers.htm">Configure Compilers</a> dialogue box
        to do this.
      </li>
      <li>
        The colours used for Snippet and other headings can now be customised
        using the <a href="dlg_prefs_display.htm">Display</a> tab of the
        <a href="dlg_preferences.htm">Preferences</a> dialogue box.
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          Snippets can now have an optional &quot;display name&quot; that,
          unlike the snippet's name, does not need to be unique. This is useful
          for giving meaningful names to snippets such as overloaded functions.
        </div>
        <div>
          For example snippets <em>ResizeRect_A</em> and <em>ResizeRect_B</em>
          in the online database now have display names <em>ResizeRect (TSize
          overload)</em> and <em>ResizeRect (Longint overload)</em> which are
          much more meaningful.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Snippet descriptions can now be formatted and can contain multiple
        paragraphs, just like &quot;extra&quot; text. Both are edited using the
        new <a href="markup_editor.htm">Markup Editor</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Syntax highlighting of source code of user defined snippets can now be
        switched off on a per-snippet basis. This mainly of use for
        <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">freeform</a> snippets that may be used
        for notes or snippets in languages other than Pascal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          Information about how a snippet from the online Code Snippets Database
          was tested is now displayed by means of a glyph at the top right of
          the detail pane, as follows:
        </div>
        <ul style="list-style: none;" class="unspaced">
          <li>
            <img
              src="..\Images\TestingBasic.png"
              class="glyph"
            >&nbsp;&nbsp;the snippet has been given some basic testing before
            uploading to the database.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="..\Images\TestingAdvanced.png"
              class="glyph"
            >&nbsp;&nbsp;the snippet has been more rigorously tested, for
            example by unit testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="..\Images\TestingNone.png"
              class="glyph"
            >&nbsp;&nbsp;the snippet has not been tested and should be used with
            care.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>
        The Welcome page has been completely redesigned to be cleaner and to
        provide more useful information about the databases and program.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Test Compilation
    </h2>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        <div>
          You can specify the paths to be searched by the Delphi compilers when
          looking for used units. This lets you compile snippets that use units
          other than those provided in the VCL and RTL. For example you can
          specify a path to the Indy components to compile them.
        </div>
        <div>
          Use the <a href="dlg_configcompilers.htm">Configure Compilers</a>
          dialogue box to set the paths on a per-compiler basis.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Results of test compilations (<span class="smallcaps">F9</span>) now
        appear in a <a href="dlg_testcompile.htm">dialogue box</a> instead of
        in a tab in the detail pane.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Other Features
    </h2>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        There is a new option on the <em>Tools</em> menu that checks
        availability of new versions of CodeSnip.
      </li>
      <li>
        Text and compiler searches can now optionally refine a previous search
        rather than always searching the entire database.
        <a href="task_search.htm">More information</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The contents of a category can now be printed.
      </li>
    </ul>
