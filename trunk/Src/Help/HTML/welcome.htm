      <em>CodeSnip</em> is a code snippets manager and viewer targetted at the
      Pascal language, with a specific emphasis on Delphi and Free Pascal
      flavours.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to managing your own code snippets, <em>CodeSnip</em> can also
      download and display source code from the DelphiDabbler <a
        class="weblink"
        target="_blank"
        href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/codesnip"
      >Code Snippets Database</a> of reusable Pascal source code.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes <em>CodeSnip</em> different from other code snippets managers
      is that it can test-compile snippets that are in the correct format. It
      can also generate a compilable unit containing suitable selected snippets,
      taking care of all dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> understands several different
      <a href="snippet_kinds.htm">kinds of snippet</a>: functions &amp;
      procedures, simple and complex type definitions (including classes and
      advanced records), constants and complete units. The is also a free-form
      format that lets you record source code in any form you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the program's multi tab interface you can navigate and search the
      database. You can copy source code, save it, print it and share it with
      others.
