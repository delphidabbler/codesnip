    </h1>
    <p>
      You can (and are encouraged to) submit your user defined snippets for
      inclusion in the Code Snippets database.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="dlg_submit.htm">Code Submission Wizard</a> is used to send
      code to <em>DelphiDabbler</em>. This is accessed from the <em>Snippets |
      Submit Snippets</em> menu item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your code may be edited to conform with the format of the database and
      must be compilable in at least one Delphi or Free Pascal compiler. It is
      helpful if you can ensure your code compiles before submitting it.
    </p>
    <p>
