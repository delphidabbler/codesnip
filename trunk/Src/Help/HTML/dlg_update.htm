      Update From Web Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box is used to update the <em>CodeSnip</em> database from the
      internet. It is displayed using the <em>Database | Update From
      Web</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Update from Web</em> button should be clicked to initiate the
      update. <strong>Note:</strong> you must ensure you are connected to the
      internet before clicking this button otherwise a &quot;Connection
      Error&quot; message will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the <em>Update from Web</em> button has been clicked it will be
      replaced by a progress report pane. The update will then begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> first logs on to the web server and then determines if
      your copy of the database is out of date. If so the latest version is
      downloaded. A progress bar is displayed while the database is being
      downloaded. A confirmatory message is displayed once the process is
      complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The database will be updated for all users, since
      each user accesses the same copy of the database.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Cancelling the update
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <em>Close</em> button is replaced by a larger <em>Cancel Update</em>
      button while the update is in progress. This button can be clicked at any
      time to cancel the update. <em>CodeSnip</em> will restore the previous
      database. <strong>Note:</strong> database downloads can't be
      interupted.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Update errors
    </h2>
    <p>
      If <em>CodeSnip</em> detects an error while updating it aborts the
      update, restores the old database and displays a brief error message at
      the top of the the dialog box. More details of the error are displayed in
      the progress report pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you see a &quot;Connection Error&quot; check your internet connection
      and try again. If you receive web server or time out errors this may be
      due to the server being down or busy so it is worth trying later.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a server or timeout error persists please inform the author via the
      DelphiDabbler website's

    <h2>
      Latest <em>CodeSnip</em> News
    </h2>
    <p>
      Click the <em>Latest News</em> button at the bottom left of the dialog box
      to see the latest news about <em>CodeSnip</em> and the online database. If
      this button is clicked while an update is in progress the update is paused
      until the dialog box is closed.
