    <p>
      This dialogue is used to re-name, (i.e. edit the description of) a
      user-defined category. It is accessed from the <em>Categories | Rename
      Category</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the category to be renamed from the list box. The category's
      description will be copied to the edit box. Change the description as
      required then click <em>Rename</em> to rename the category.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leading and trailing spaces in the description are ignored. If you enter
      a description already used by another category a warning to that effect is
      displayed below the edit box. The <em>Rename</em> button will be disabled
      if you haven't selected a category from the list, if you haven't changed
      the description or if the description is already in use.
