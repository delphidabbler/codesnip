    </h1>
    <p>
      You can add your own code snippets to the database as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Click the <img
          src="../Images/AddSnippet.gif"
          class="glyph"
          alt="Add Snippet button"
        > toolbar button or choose the <em>Snippets | New Snippet</em> menu
        option.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide information about the snippet, along with its source code in the
        resulting <a href="dlg_editsnippet.htm">Add a Snippet</a> dialog box.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Existing user-defined snippets can be edited or deleted by selecting the
      required snippet and choosing the <em>Edit Snippet</em> and <em>Delete
      Snippet</em> options on the <em>Database</em> menu or using the 
      <img
        src="../Images/EditSnippet.gif"
        class="glyph"
        alt="Edit Snippet button"
      > or 
      <img
        src="../Images/DeleteSnippet.gif"
        class="glyph"
        alt="Delete Snippet button"
      > toolbar buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snippets can be categorised using any of the existing categories, or you
      can define your own using the <em>Categories | New Category</em> menu
      item. You can also rename your categories (<em>Categories | Rename
      Category</em>) and delete them when no longer needed (<em>Categories |
      Delete Category</em>). If you don't want to categorise them, just use the
      predefined <em>User Defined Snippets</em> category to keep them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changes to the user database are indicated by the display of a
      &quot;Modified&quot; flag in the status bar. The database can be saved
      using the <em>Database | Save User Database</em> menu option or the
      <img
        src="../Images/SaveDatabase.png"
        class="glyph"
        alt="Save User Database button"
      > toolbar button. <strong>Note:</strong> the user database is
      automatically saved when <em>CodeSnip</em> is closed normally. The
      database can also be backed up and restored from the <em>Database</em>
      menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snippets from the main database cannot be edited or deleted. User defined
      snippets are displayed in a different colour to the snippets from the main
      database.
