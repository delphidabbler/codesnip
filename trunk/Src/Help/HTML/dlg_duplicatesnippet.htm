    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is used to duplicate the currently selected snippet,
      creating a new user defined snippet. The dialogue box is accessed from the
      <em>Snippet | Duplicate Snippet</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter a unique name for the duplicated snippet in the <em>Unique name for
      duplicated snippet</em> edit control. A suitable name will be suggested.
      When duplicating a snippet from the main database it may be possible to
      use the same name, providing a snippet of that name does not already
      exist in the user database. If this is the case the suggested name will be
      the same as the original snippet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The display name of the duplicated snippet can be edited or entered in the
      <em>Display name</em> edit box. If the snippet being duplicated has a
      display name different to its unique name, the name will be displayed
      here, otherwise the edit box will be empty. Leave the edit box blank to
      use the name entered in the <em>Unique name for duplicated snippet</em>
      edit box as the display name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new snippet's category can be changed using the <em>Choose categegory
      for duplicate snippet</em> drop-down list. The category of the original
      snippet will already be selected, making it easy to create the new snippet
      in the same category.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>OK</em> to go ahead and create the new snippet. If the snippet
      name is invalid or is not unique an error message will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newly duplicated snippet can be edited in the <a
        href="dlg_editsnippet.htm"
      >Snippets Editor</a> immediately after clicking the <em>OK</em> button. To
      do this tick the <em>Edit in Snippets Editor </em> check box. If you don't
      want to display the <em>Snippets Editor</em> leave the check box clear.
      <strong>Note:</strong> The duplicated snippet is added to the database
      when this dialogue box closes, before the <em>Snippets Editor</em> is
      displayed. Therefore cancelling the <em>Snippets Editor</em> will not
      remove the duplicated snippet from the database.
