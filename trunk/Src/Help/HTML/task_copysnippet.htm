    </h1>
    <p>
      There are three options ways for copying a snippet of code to the
      clipboard.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Copy Information
    </h2>
    <p>
      Copies all the information about the selected snippet to the clipboard in
      both plain text and rich text format. The rich text format version syntax
      highlights the source code.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option applies to any kind of snippet. Simply select a snippet in the
      <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a> and then use the <em>Edit |
      Copy Information</em> menu option or press
      <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+I</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Copy Snippet
    </h2>
    <p>
      Copies either a single selected snippet or a category of snippets. The
      Snippets are copied as a valid compilable Pascal fragment. Notes of any
      required units or other routines are included as comments. Both plain text
      and as rich text copies are placed on the clipboard with the rich text
      version being syntax highlighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A snippets description may be included as a comment, depending on the
      commenting style specified on the
      <a href="dlg_prefs_sourcecode.htm">Code Formatting tab</a> of the
      <a href="dlg_preferences.htm">Preferences dialog box</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option applies only to single routines (not types or constants) or
      to categories that contain routines. Simply select a suitable snippet or
      category in the <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a> then choose
      the <em>Edit | Copy Snippet</em> menu option or press
      <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+N</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Copy Source Code
    </h2>
    <p>
      Copies only the source code of the selected snippet in plain text and in
      rich text format. Again the rich text copy is syntax highlighted. The
      snippet's description is not included as comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option applies to any kind of snippet. Select a snippet in the
      <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a> and then use the <em>Edit |
      Copy Source Code</em> menu option or press
      <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+U</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can copy either a single routine or a whole category of routines to
      the clipboard. The code is copied as a valid Pascal fragment. Notes of
      any required units or other routines are included as comments. To copy a
      routine proceed as follows:
