          Saves the source code of the currently selected routine or category
          to a file. The file is a fragment of Pascal code. The
          <a href="dlg_savesnippet.htm">Save Snippet</a> dialogue box is
          displayed and is used to determine the format of the file being saved.
          This can be plain text, a Pascal include file, HTML or RTF. The latter
          two options can be syntax highlighted. Not available for type
          definition and constant snippets.
