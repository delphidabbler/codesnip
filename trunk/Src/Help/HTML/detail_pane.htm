      When a snippet is selected the display contains:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A brief description of the snippet.
      </li>
      <li>
        The source code (syntax highlighted).
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        A list of other snippet called by the selected snippet.

      Clicking any of the snippets in the &quot;Required snippets&quot; and
      &quot;See also&quot; lists causes the snippet in question to be
      displayed. You can return to the original snippet using the
