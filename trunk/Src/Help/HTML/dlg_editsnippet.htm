      Edit Snippet Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is displayed when either the <em>Snippets | New
      Snippet</em> or <em>Snippets | Edit Snippet</em> menu options are
      selected. It is used to enter details of a new user defined code snippet
      or to edit the details of an existing user-defined snippet.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a new snippet is being added all controls are blank or set to default
      values. When an existing snippet is being edited the controls are
      populated with the snippet's existing properties.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Editing the snippet
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dialogue has multiple tabs. All but the <em>Code</em> tab are optional
      &ndash; others can be used to provide additional information about the
      snippet. However, if you plan to test compile the snippet you must ensure
      that the snippet's dependencies and units are properly set up on the
      <em>References</em> tab.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Code Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      This tab gathers all the information needed to define a snippet. All the
      fields are required. They are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Name</em>
        </div>
        <div>
          Enter a name for the snippet in the edit box. The name must be a valid
          Unicode Pascal identifier. It must also be unique within the user
          database, it may duplicate names in the main database.
        </div>
        <div>
          It is customary to name functions or procedures using the routine's
          name. Overloaded routines are often named by suffixing the routine
          name with '_A', '_B', '_C' and so on.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Description</em>
        </div>
        <div>
          Enter a description of the code snippet in the
          <a href="markup_editor.htm">markup editor</a>. You can use more than
          one paragraph of text. You have the choice of styling the text and
          using hyperlinks.
        </div>
        <div>
          The description field should not contain &quot;}&quot; characters
          since the field's text is used in comments in exported Pascal code and
          the &quot;}&quot; character will terminate the comment early.
        </div>
        <div>
          The description can be previewed using the <em>Preview</em> button.
          Clicking this button also validates markup if you have used it.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Kind</em>
        </div>
        <div>
          Select the <a href="snippet_kinds.htm">kind of snippet</a> from the
          drop down list.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Category</em>
        </div>
        <div>
          Select the category to which the snippet belongs from the drop down
          list.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Source code</em>
        </div>
        <div>
          Enter the snippet's source code in this text box. The format of the
          source code is important unless you are using the freeform snippet
          kind.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      References Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      Use this tab to specify the snippets and units that are associated with
      the snippet being edited. If it is intended to test compile the snippet
      then the <em>Dependencies</em> and <em>Units</em> list boxes must be
      completed if the snippet depends on a Delphi unit or if it uses another
      snippet from the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      The available controls are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Cross-references</em> list box
        </div>
        <div>
          Use this list box to specify any other snippets to be cross-referenced
          from this snippet. Check the boxes next to desired snippets. Cross
          references are for information only. All snippets are listed, except
          for the one being edited.
        </div>
        <div>
          User defined snippets are displayed in blue.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Dependencies</em> list box
        </div>
        <div>
          Specify any other snippets that this snippet depends upon by checking
          the boxes next to the desired snippets in this list box. If this
          snippet is to be test compiled then any other snippets it requires
          must be specified here or the test compile will fail. The exception is
          that <a href="snippet_unit.htm">unit snippets</a> never have any
          dependencies.
        </div>
        <div>
          The available entries in this list box will vary according to the
          <a href="snippet_kinds.htm">snippet kind</a> and the kind of snippets
          it can depend on. For example, <a href="snippet_constant.htm">constant
          snippets</a> can't depend on <a href="snippet_routine.htm">routine</a>
          snippets and <a href="snippet_unit.htm">unit snippets</a> can't depend
          on anything, so the list is empty.
          <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">Freeform</a> snippets are never
          included.
        </div>
        <div>
          User defined snippets are displayed in blue.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>View Dependencies</em> button
        </div>
        <div>
          Click this button to see all dependencies for the snippet being edited
          in the <a href="dlg_dependencies.htm">Dependencies dialogue box</a>.
          All entries checked in the <em>Dependencies</em> list box are
          included, along with all their dependencies, and so on. You must not
          create a circular dependency; the <em>Dependencies</em> dialogue box
          will help you detect them.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Units</em> list box
        </div>
        <div>
          Select any units that this snippet requires in order to compile using
          this list box. Required units must be specified if test compilation is
          to be attempted. A selection of common units is provided, along with
          any units already associated with the snippet. More units can be added
          to the list &ndash; see below.
        </div>
        <div>
          Units are &quot;used&quot; in the order they appear in the list. If
          this order causes namespace clashes you should prefix ambiguous
          identifiers in the source code with the unit name, e.g.
          <code>Graphics.TBitmap</code>.
        </div>
        <div>
          <a href="snippet_unit.htm">Unit snippets</a> must declare their used
          units in the unit source code, so this list box is disabled when the
          snippet kind is <em>unit</em>.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Add Unit</em> edit box and button
        </div>
        <div>
          If additional units are required in the <em>Units</em> check list box
          type the name of the unit in the edit box and click the <em>Add
          Unit</em> button. The unit will be added to the <em>Units</em> check
          list box and its check box will be checked.
        </div>
        <div>
          This button is disabled for <a href="snippet_unit.htm">unit
          snippets</a>.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Extra Information Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      This tab is used to provide additional descriptive information about the
      snippet. Use it for information that supplements the snippet's
      description or for crediting authors etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter the required information in the <em>Extra information</em>
      <a href="markup_editor.htm">markup editor</a>. You can enter either plain
      text of formatted text and hyperlinks using the custom
      <a href="reml.htm">REML</a> markup language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information can be previewed using the <em>Preview</em> button.
      Clicking this button also validates markup if you have used it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Compile Results Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      Use this tab to specify any known compiler results for the snippet. You
      can specify the required compiler in several ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Manually, one compiler at a time using the <em>Set a compile
        results</em> list box. Click the drop down button next to the required
        compiler then choose the required compile result from the drop down
        menu, i.e. one of <em>Success</em>, <em>Warning</em>, <em>Error</em> and
        <em>Unknown</em>. To use the keyboard to modify compile results proceed
        as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Move the keyboard focus to the list box using the
            <span class="smallcaps">Tab</span> key.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select the required compiler using the
            <span class="smallcaps">Up</span> and
            <span class="smallcaps">Down</span> keys.
          </li>
          <li>
            Press <span class="smallcaps">Space</span> to drop down the menu.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select the required result with the
            <span class="smallcaps">Up</span> and
            <span class="smallcaps">Down</span> keys.
          </li>
          <li>
            Press <span class="smallcaps">Enter</span> to select the compile
            result or <span class="smallcaps">Cancel</span> to abort.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <em>Set All To Success</em> button to set every compiler's
        result to &quot;success&quot; (green LED).
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <em>Set All To Query</em> button to set every compiler's
        result &quot;query&quot; (grey LED).
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          Use the <em>Test Compile</em> button to compile the snippet and set
          the compile results accordingly. This button is disabled if no
          compilers are configured or if the snippet is
          <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">freeform</a>.
        </div>
        <div>
          If one or more compilers report warnings or errors, a link appears
          below the <em>Test Compile</em> button that can be clicked to display
          details of the warnings or errors.
        </div>
        <div>
          You can display the unit used to perform the test compilation by
          clicking the <em>View Test Unit</em> button. This can be useful when
          tracking down errors.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Commiting the edit
    </h2>
    <p>
      Clicking <em>OK</em> causes the edited snippet to be validated. If an
      error is found the control where the error is located is selected and an
      error message is displayed. If the snippet is valid the dialogue box
      closes and the user database is updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>Cancel</em> to abort the edit.
