      This tab of the <a
        href="dlg_preferences.htm"
      >Preferences</a> dialogue box is used for miscellaneous preferences that
      don't merit a tab of their own. The tab is accessed by selecting the
      <em>Tools | Preferences</em> menu item then clicking the <em>Misc.</em>
      tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is only a single option that can be set on this tab.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Measurement
    </h2>
    <p>
      Select the measurement units to be used by the application from the
      <em>Preferred units of measurement</em> drop down list. Options are
      <em>Inches</em> and <em>Millimeters</em>. If you have not set this option
      before, the measurement units will default to your locale settings.
