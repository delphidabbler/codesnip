      <a name="dlg_registration"></a>Registration Wizard
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box is used to register <em>CodeSnip</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note</strong> You do not have to register <em>CodeSnip</em> to
      use it. However, the author hopes you will register so that he knows that
      <em>CodeSnip</em> is being used and is worth maintaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialog takes the form of a multi-page wizard that gathers
      registration information and submits it online. You move through the
      pages by clicking the <em>Next</em> button and can return to a previous
      page using the <em>Back</em> button. The <em>Cancel</em> button closes
      the wizard without registering the application.
    </p>
    <h2>
      First page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page simply displays some introductory text.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Second page
    </h2>
    <p>
      You use this page to provide information about yourself. All you need to
      provide is your name or a nickname.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Third page
    </h2>
    <p>
      Along with the information you have entered <em>CodeSnip</em> will have
      collected some information about itself and your operating system that it
      will send to the web server. All the information that will be sent is
      displayed on this page.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are happy to send the information please make sure you are
      connected to the internet and click the <em>Submit</em> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program will now attempt to connect to <a
        href="http://www.delphidabbler.com"
        target="_blank"
        class="weblink"
      >www.delphidabbler.com</a> and send the registration
      information. If the report is sent successfully the wizard&#39;s final
      page will be displayed. Should an error be detected an error message
      describing the problem will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have concerns about privacy, please read the <a
        href="privacy_statement.htm"
      >privacy statement</a> before submitting.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Fourth page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page is shown when the registration has been successful. The
      program&#39;s registration code will be displayed in a box. This value
      is automatically stored by <em>CodeSnip</em> in its configuration file.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can now close the dialog box by clicking the <em>Finish</em> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note <em>CodeSnip</em> should be registered only once per computer,
      regardless of the number of users. If other users wish to join the mailing
      list they can do so using the <em>Tools | Join Mailing List</em> menu
      option.
