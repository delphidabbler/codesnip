    <p>
      This dialogue box is displayed when <em>CodeSnip</em> encounters an
      unexpected error. It invites you to report the error using the
      <em>CodeSnip</em> online bug tracker which, at the time of writing, is
      located on <em>SourceForge.net</em>..

      The bug tracker is accessed by clicking the <em>Go to the Bug Tracker</em>
      link or by pressing <span class="smallcaps">Alt+B</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the <em>Terminate CodeSnip</em> button if you want to close the
      application down. A confirmation dialogue box is displayed before the
      application is finally closed. If you don't want to close the program
      click <em>Continue</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>
