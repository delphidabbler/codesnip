  NOTE:

  This program gets the path to the application data folder for the current
  user and writes it to a file.

  The file is a text file in the INI file format. There is only one section,
  named SpecialFolders. The path to the application data folder is written to
  the only key in the section, named CSIDL_APPDATA.

  This format can obviously be extended with other user specific special
  folders.
