# Required macros
# ---------------
#
# Make will fail if any of the following macros is not defined.
#
# BIN
#   Must be defined in the calling script to address the directory that is to
#   receive .res and .dcu output files
#
# DELPHIROOT (or DELPHI2006)
#   DELPHIROOT must address the installation directory of the required Delphi
#   compiler. Any compiler from Delphi 2006 onwards can be used. If Delphi 2006
#   is to be used the DELPHI2006 macro must be defined to address the Delphi
#   2006 installation directory. When DELPHI2006 is defined any existing value
#   of DELPHIROOT is ignored and DELPHI2006 is used instead.
#
# INDY10
#   Must be set to the directory where the Indy 10 components are installed. The
#   components must have been built with the same version of Delphi that is to
#   be used to compile the program.


# Check for DELPHI2006 macro and use it for DELPHIROOT if set.

!ifdef DELPHI2006
DELPHIROOT = $(DELPHI2006)
!endif

# Check for required macros

!ifndef DELPHIROOT
!error DELPHIROOT environment variable required.
!endif
!ifndef INDY10
!error INDY10 environment variable required.
!endif
!ifndef BIN
!error BIN macro must be defined in calling script.
!endif

# Define common macros that access required build tools

MAKE = "$(MAKEDIR)\Make.exe" -$(MAKEFLAGS)
DCC32 = "$(DELPHIROOT)\Bin\DCC32.exe"
BRCC32 = "$(DELPHIROOT)\Bin\BRCC32.exe"
!ifdef VIEDROOT
VIED = "$(VIEDROOT)\VIEd.exe" -makerc
!else
VIED = VIEd.exe -makerc
!endif

# Implicit rules

# Delphi projects are assumed to contain required output and search path
# locations in the project options .cfg file.
.dpr.exe:
  @echo +++ Compiling Delphi Project $< +++
  @$(DCC32) $< -B -U"$(INDY10)"

# Resource files are compiled to the directory specified by BIN macro, which
# must have been set by the caller.
.rc.res:
  @echo +++ Compiling Resource file $< +++
  @$(BRCC32) $< -fo$(BIN)\$(@F)

# Version info files are compiled by VIEd. A temporary .rc file is left behind
.vi.rc:
  @echo +++ Compiling Version Info file $< +++
  @$(VIED) .\$<
