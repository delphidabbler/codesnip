{
 * UDlgHelper.pas
 *
 * Implements "static" classes that help to manipulate dialog boxes.
 *
 * Originally named UDlgAligner.pas. Renamed as UDlgHelper.pas as at v1.1.
 *
 * v1.0 of 27 Sep 2007  - Original version.
 * v1.1 of 12 Jun 2008  - Added new TDlgHelper class.
 *                      - Renamed some private interfaces and classes.
 *                      - Fixed potential bug in renamed TWindowInfoFactory.
 *                      - Added new Handle method to renamed IWindowInfo
 *                        interface.
 *                      - Added new AlignToOwner method to TDlgAligner.
 *                      - Renamed from UDlgAligner.pas to UDlgHelper.pas.
 * v1.2 of 04 Oct 2008  - Revised TDlgHelper and private factory classes to
 *                        derive from TNoConstructObject and hence prevented
 *                        them from being constructed.
 *                      - Revised TDlgAligner to use protected constructor and
 *                        prevented public constructor from being called.
 *                      - Made various private sections strict.
 *                      - Now use ClassName method in all assert and raise EBug
 *                        statements.
 * v1.3 of 15 Dec 2008  - Modified to use TRectEx record instead of TRect.
