{
 * UBaseObjects.pas
 *
 * Contains various common classes for use as base classes to other classes.
 * Classes are:
 *
 *   1) TNoConstructObject:
 *      Object that fails if its constructor is called. Provided as a base class
 *      for classes that contains only class methods and should never be
 *      constructed.
 *   2) TNoPublicConstructObject:
 *      Object that provides a protected constructor but fails if the public
 *      constructor is called. For use as a base class for objects that are
 *      constructed via class methods but should not be constructed directly.
 *   3) TNoPublicConstructIntfObject:
 *      Same as 2) except class descends from TInterfacedObject instead of
 *      TObject.
 *   4) TNonRefCountedObject implements a non reference counted implementation
 *      of IInterface.
 *   5) TAggregatedOrLoneObject is a base class for objects that can either
 *      exist as aggregated objects or as stand-alone reference counted objects.
 *      This implementation is based on code suggested by Hallvard VossBotn, as
 *      presented in Eric Harmon's book "Delphi COM programming".
 *   6) TConditionalFreeObject:
 *      An abstract base class for objects that cannot be destroyed unless some
 *      condition is met.
 *
 * Also provides an interface - INoPublicConstruct - that can be supported by
 * objects that don't allow public construction but cannot inherited from
 * TNoPublicConstructObject, for example forms.

  {
  TNoConstructObject:
    Class that fails if its constructor is called. Provided as a base class for
    classes that contain only class methods and should never be constructed.
  }
  TNoConstructObject = class(TObject)
  public
    constructor Create;
      {Class constructor. Causes an assertion failure if called. The object is
      never constructed.
      }
  end;

  {
  TNoPublicConstructObject:
    Class that provides a protected constructor but fails if the public
    constructor is called. For use as a base class for objects that are
    constructed via class methods but should not be constructed directly.
  }
  TNoPublicConstructObject = class(TObject)
  strict protected
    constructor InternalCreate;
      {Protected class constructor. Does nothing but call inherited constructor.
      Should be called by class methods of derived classes instead of inherited
      Create.
      }
  public
    constructor Create;
      {Class constructor. Causes an assertion failure if called. The object is
      never constructed.
      }
  end;

  {
  TNoPublicConstructIntfObject:
    Class that provides a protected constructor but fails if the public
    constructor is called. For use as a base class for reference counted
    interfaced objects that are constructed via class methods but should not be
    constructed directly.
  }
  TNoPublicConstructIntfObject = class(TInterfacedObject)
  strict protected
    constructor InternalCreate;

      Create.
      }

    constructor Create;
      {Class constructor. Causes an assertion failure if called. The object is
      never constructed.
      }
  end;

  {
  INoPublicConstruct:
    Interface that can be supported by objects that do not permit public
    construction but that cannot descend from TNoPublicConstructObject. Such
    objects must handle their own detection of attempts to call public
    constructor. An example of use is in forms that may not be publically
    constructed. It is also useful to flag some members of a class heirachy as
    no public construct while leaving others able to be constructed.
    The interface provides no additional methods - it exists purely for
    detection purposes.
    To flag an object as no-public-construct, add INoPublicConstruct to its type
    definition then test for it in the public constructor using
    Supports(Self, INoPublicConstruct).
  }
  INoPublicConstruct = interface(IInterface)
    ['{1170DC2C-5B79-453A-94AB-2C35B583F4BD}']
  end;

  {
  TNonRefCountedObject:
    Implements a non reference counted implementation of IInterface. It derives
    directly from TObject rather than TInterfacedObject since most of the
    code of TInterfacedObject is redundant when reference counting not used.

      count is not updated and instance is never freed.

  end;

  {
  TAggregatedOrLoneObject:
    Base class for objects that can either exist as aggregated objects
    (as specified by the "implements" directive) or as stand-alone reference
    counted objects. If the IInterface reference of the containing (controller)
    object is passed to the constructor this object behaves as an aggregated
    object and defers to the container object for reference counting and
    interface queries. When nil is passed to the constructor or the
    parameterless constructor is called the object bahaves as a stand alone
    implementation and handles its own reference counting.
