  NOTES:

  Exceptions are treated as bugs unless they derive from ECodeSnip. This means
  that the application needs to trap any expected exceptions that are not
  derived from ECodeSnip.

  The EBug exception class is also provided for explicitly generating bug
  exceptions.

  Untrapped ECodeSnip exceptions result in the display of an error dialog box
  while all others lead to display of a bug report dialog box.

    Base class for exceptions that can be assigned the properties of another

    Such exception must support an Assign method that copies the properties of

    properties should extend Assign to copy the extra properties. Descendants
