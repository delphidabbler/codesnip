{
 * IntfNotifier.pas
 *
 * Defines interfaces to set up and use the notifier object that triggers

 *
 * v0.1 of 22 Feb 2005  - Original version.
 * v0.2 of 25 Apr 2005  - Added new HelpTopic and ConfigCompilers methods to
 *                        INotifier and corresponding SetHelpTopicAction methods
 *                        to ISetActions interface that adds support for new
 *                        actions that the new methods trigger.
 *                      - Removed INotifier.QuickStartHelp and
 *                        ISetActions.SetQuickStartHelpAction methods that are
 *                        superceded by new help topic methods noted above.
 * v1.0 of 24 May 2006  - Improved and corrected comments.
 *                      - Removed warnings about un-fixed interfaces - now
 *                        fixed.
 *                      - Removed unused unit reference.
 * v1.1 of 23 Nov 2006  - Added SetToggleTestUnitAction method to ISetActions.
 *                      - Added ToggleTestUnit method to INotifier.
 * v1.2 of 04 Nov 2007  - Removed INotifier.HelpTopic method.
 *                      - Removed ISetActions.SetHelpTopicAction method.
 * v1.3 of 14 Sep 2008  - Changed signature of INotifier.DisplayRoutine method
 *                        to take a parameter identifying which database routine
 *                        is from. Changed to support user database.
 *                      - Added new INotifier.EditRoutine method and setter
 *                        method for associated action.
 *                      - Added new ISetActions.SetEditRoutineAction method.
 * v1.4 of 23 May 2009  - Replaced INotifier's ToggleTestUnit with ShowTestUnit.
 *                      - Replaced ISetActions' SetToggleTestUnitAction with
 *                        SetShowTestUnitAction.
