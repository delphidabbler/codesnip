  TDDabStdWebService:
    Web service class that interacts with standard DelphiDabbler web services.
    These services always place a numeric status code in first line of response
    followed by any resulting data. Status code is zero for normal responses and
    non-zero when an error response is returned. This class outputs data for
    normal responses and generates EWebServiceError exceptions for error
    responses, using the response data as the error message. Malformed responses
    generate EWebServiceFailure exceptions.
