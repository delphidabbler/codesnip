      Use this page to enter any additional information relating to the snippet,
      such as usage instructions, credits, and links to online references.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information can be formatted text using a simple
      <a
        href="help:REML"
        class="help-link"
      >HTML-like markup language</a> called <em>REML</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do not have to use the markup language features. However, whether you
      use markup or not, you must not use the &quot;&lt;&quot; or
      &quot;&amp;&quot; characters since these are special within the markup
      language. The
      <span
        class="elem"
      >&amp;lt;</span> character entity must be used in place of &quot;&lt;&quot
      and
      <span
        class="elem"
      >&amp;amp;</span> in place of &quot;&amp;&quot;.
