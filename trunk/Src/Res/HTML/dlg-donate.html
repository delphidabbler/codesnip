      CodeSnip is free to use and there is no requirement to pay anything for
      it. You get a fully working version of the program whether you make a
      donation or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Having said that, it takes time and money to maintain both
      CodeSnip and the online database. So if you wish to make a contribution it
      will be most welcome.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Payment, in pounds sterling, can be made by
      <strong>PayPal</strong>&trade;.
    </p>

    <p>
      Make sure you are connected to the internet then click the
      <strong>Make Donation</strong> button. This will display the
      DelphiDabbler PayPal&trade; donation page in your web browser.
    </p>

      Many thanks.
