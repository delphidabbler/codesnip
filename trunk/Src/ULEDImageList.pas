{
  Note: resources must contain a valid bitmap named "LEDS" that combines all
  four bitmaps, each 18px x 18px. This combined bitmap may be in one of three
  formats:
    18px x 72px => LEDs are in a vertical column
    36px x 36px => LEDs are in two rows of two, varying by row
    72px x 18px => LEDs are in a horizontal row
  Ordering must be
     S    or    SW    or   SWEQ
     W          EQ
     E
     Q
  Where S = success (green), W = warning (yellow), E = error (red) and
  Q = query (grey).
  The mask colour must be clFuchsia.
