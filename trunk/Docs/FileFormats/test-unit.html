<h1>
  Test Units
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  CodeSnip saves temporary test units that are valid Pascal unit. These units
  are used to perform test compiles.
</p>

<p>
  There is no specific file format for these files, other than they are valid
  Object Pascal source code.
</p>

<h2>
  Encoding
</h2>

<p>
  The encoding used for test units depends on the content of the unit.
</p>

<p>
  If the unit's source code contains only characters that are supported by the
  system default ANSI code page the file is saved using the default ANSI
  encoding.
</p>

<p>
  If the source code contains one or more characters that cannot be represented
  in the default ANSI code page then the file is saved as UTF-8, with byte order
  mark.
</p>

<p class="pullout">
  Note that files are saved using the ANSI default encoding if possible because
  earlier versions of Delphi cannot read UTF-8 encoded files and do not support
  Unicode characters in the source code. Versions of Delphi that permit Unicode
  characters in source code can read UTF-8 source files.
</p>

<p class="pullout">
  Unit filenames are limited to ANSI characters again for reasons of
  compatibility with earlier Delphis because they will report Unicode file names
  as &quot;not found&quot;.
