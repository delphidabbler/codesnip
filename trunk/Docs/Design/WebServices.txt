DelphiDabbler Standard Web Service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A DelphiDabbler Standard Web Service object has the following attributes:

* It connects to the web service over HTTP.

* Requests are made using HTTP Post. Information is POSTed to the web service
  either in the form of URL encoded query strings or as raw post data. Which
  format is used depends on web service.

* Web services respond with plain text. The text is encoded as the default for
  the server which defaults to ISO-8859-1.

* The response text is split into lines by CRLF pairs. There is always at least
  one line in a response. Any trailing CRLFs should be stripped from the
  response text.

* The first line of the response always contains a status code. A zero code
  indicates success, while non-zero codes indicate an error. The meaning of the
  error code is specific to the web service. Consult the documentation of the
  service for details.

* A successful response *may* include further information, starting from the
  second line of the text. The meaning of this text depends on the web service.
  Consult the documentation of the service for details.

* An error response *must* include an error message starting from the second
  line of the text. Error messages *may* have more than one line.

Some web services also require that the correct user agent string for the
service is used. Such web services return HTTP error 403 if the user agent is
not valid. User agent strings *may* also specify the version of the web service
to be used.

The response format in ABNF is:

  response = status_code [CRLF data] [CRLF]
  status_code = success_code / error_code
  success_code = "0"
  error_code = ["-"] 1*DIGIT
  data = data_line [CRLF data]
  data_line = 0*[VCHAR | WSP]

The class TStdWebService, which inherits from TBaseWebService, provides core
functionality for working with standard web services. In particular it:

* Provides methods for posting data in the form of query strings to the web
  service.

* Handles the response, checking the status code. When an error code is received
  an exception is raised using the error message from the response. In the case
  of a successful response the status code line is stripped and the remaining
  data made available for processing by descendant classes.
