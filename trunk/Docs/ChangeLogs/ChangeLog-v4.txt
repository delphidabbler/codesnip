Release v4.4.0 of 08 April 2013
+ Implemented feature request #75 "Check for updates on start-up" (http://bit.ly/ZJ8OGH):
  - CodeSnip checks for both program and Code Snippets Database updates in low priority background threads that run when the program is first started.
  - Update checking takes place at intervals between once per day and once per month.

+ Additional usage information is now sent to the DelphiDabbler Code Snippets database update web service.
+ Some refactoring and code clean-up.
+ The installer may now display an information page that describes the new automatic update checking feature. This page is displayed only when updating from v4.3.0 or earlier to v4.4.0 (or later).
