; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 4.0 alpha 2 (preview) of 21 April 2012
+ New features:
  - New "unit" snippet type that enables complete units to be stored in database and to be test compiled.
  - New "classes" snippet type that enables a single Object Pascal class or advanced record-with-methods to be stored in database, test compiled and included in generated units.
  - Snippets from both the user and main databases can now be duplicated. Duplicates are editable and are stored in the user database.
  - Online CodeSnip FAQs can now be displayed in the default browser from a new option on the "Help" menu.
+ Interface changes:
  - New "Snippets" and "Categories" top level menus have been added. They are populated with items previously on the "Database" menu. "Snippets" menu also has new "Duplicate Snippet" item.
  - "Help" menu re-arranged: items from the former "On The Web" sub-menu are now placed directly on "Help" menu.
  - Numerous new and updated glyphs on toolbar, menu and in main display.
  - Minor tweaks to controls in the Code tab of the Snippets Editor.
  - Minor changes to the style of version info displayed on the splash screen.
+ Bug fixes:
  - Fixed potential source of a bug in code that edits user-defined categories.
  - Fixed unreported minor bug in dialog boxes that display tabbed page controls: clicking a tab did not always give it the keyboard focus.
  - Fixed bug #3519784 (http://bit.ly/IsCsun) where multi-line "type" or "constant" snippets that start on the same line as the type or const keyword were corrupted when included in units using the "comments after snippet header" comment style.
+ Characters used to introduced switches on the command line were changed: '/' replaces '\'. '-' is still permitted.
+ User and main database formats modified. User databases saved with this version may not be readable with release 4.0 alpha 1.
+ Some refactoring.
+ Help file updated in line with changes and some errors fixed.
+ Updated documentation.
