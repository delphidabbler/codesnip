                       colour constant.

                       colour the dialog's header rather than hard wired
                       colour formerly in HTML template file.

                       is now an HTML frame containing the heading and two
                       further frames giving informaion about program and
                       database, hosted by a page control. Database frame

                         return required height of body panel which now
                         depends on height of heading frame and page control,
                         which in turn is sized to the longest of the HTML
                         documents it contains.

v2.5 of 24 Aug 2008  - Modified to work with revised contributor classes to
                       get list of names of code contributors and testers.

v0.1 of 30 Jan 2005  - Original version.
v0.2 of 17 Mar 2005  - If no owner form provided form now align's over
                       application's main form rather than not aligning.
v0.3 of 19 Apr 2005  - Added code to prevent help being activated on F1 if
                       help button is invisible.
v1.0 of 05 Jun 2006  - Added code to detect ESC key presses and to close
                       dialog if descendant-supplied modal result is not
                       mrNone. This added because some dialogs ignore ESC
                       when certain controls have focus. Added an abstract
                       method to return required modal result.
                     - Improved and corrected comments.
v1.1 of 03 Dec 2006  - Made AlignToOwner method protected and virtual instead
                       of private and static to enable it to be overridden in
                       sub classes.
                     - Added protected ArrangeAndAlign method that calls
                       ArrangeForm and AlignToOwner. This can be called by
                       subclasses that change size of form after this class
                       has aligned it, and therefore need to resize and
                       re-align the dialog.
v1.2 of 04 Feb 2007  - Removed now unused parameter from DisplayHelp call in
                       help button click event handler.
v2.0 of 07 Feb 2007  - Rewrote in terms of new alignment and customisation
                       code in TBaseForm:
                       - Removed FormCreate event handler and AlignToOwner
                         method. Their functionality is now provided by the
                         TFormAligner object.
                       - Removed ArrangeAndAlign method. This was called by
                         subclasses to re-align the form. There is no need
                         for this now using the new customisation / alignment
                         framework.
                       - Added new, virtual, do nothing, ConfigForm method
                         that allows subclasses to configure and resize the
                         form. This method is called before the form is
                         aligned.
                       - Overrode various of the new virtual methods of
                         TBaseForm.
v2.1 of 26 Sep 2007  - Changed to use renamed IFormAligner interface.
v2.2 of 11 Jun 2008  - Added calls to TDlgHelper to set dialog box's parent.
                       This change needed for app to work correctly with
                       Vista task bar.

v1.1 of 03 Dec 2006  - Changed to re-align form to owner after resizing to fit
                       HTML content.
v2.0 of 07 Feb 2007  - Rewrote to work with revised TGenericDlg base class and
                       new form customisation / aligment framework:
                       - Overrode new ConfigForm method to initialise the HTML
                         displayed in browser control before sizing the body
                         panel to fit the content.
                       - Added InitHTMLFrame abstract method that subclasses
                         override to initialise HTML in browser.
                       - Revised UpdateFormHeight method to remove call to
                         resize form. Renamed method as SizeBodyPanel.
v2.1 of 11 Feb 2007  - Added new abstract GetBodyPanelHeight method to return
                       required height of body panel.
                     - Changed SizeBodyPanel method to simply set body panel
                       height to value returned from GetBodyPanelHeight method.
                       We no longer simply assume the body panel should be the
                       same height as the HTML frame since there may be more
                       than one frame in a HTML dialog.
                     - Removed unused GetBrowser abstract method.

                     - Search dialogs now return search objects rather than

v1.9 of 03 Dec 2006  - Fixed bug where Test Compile actions were always
                       enabled, permitting action to be triggered when no
                       routine selected or no available compilers. This was
                       causing an assertion failure.
v1.10 of 04 Dec 2006 - Added View / Hide Test unit menu item and added glyphs
                       to existing action.
v1.11 of 03 Feb 2007 - Added support for displaying prompts and database and
                       search related information in status bar.

                       managing status bar.
v1.12 of 04 Feb 2007 - Changed to use Query object for filtering database
                       rather than calling display manager.
                     - Now uses global query object to find details of
                       current search query rather than use TDetailView
                       object.
                     - Changed to use renamed CurrentView property of main
                       display manager.
v1.13 of 04 Feb 2007 - Changed QuickStart, License and Compiler Checks help
                       actions to directly call inherited DisplayHelp method
                       rather than triggering special help action.
v1.14 of 08 Feb 2007 - Tidied up code and reduced number of required units:
                     - Removed custom action and custom menu fields and

                       resource bitmap from FormCreate event.
                     - Removed fWBExternal and fWBNulDropTarget fields and
                       replaced them with local variables inside FormCreate
                       event.
                     - Replaced FormKeyDown event handler used to generated
                       test bug exception with action that does same thing.
                     - Changed actTestCompileIndirectExecute to use new
                       static Run method of TWaitForActionUI class.
                     - Changed to use TDialogMgr to display main dialog
                       boxes.
v1.15 of 11 Feb 2007 - Changed info and detail frames so they are not tab
                       stops - now only tab controls, routine tree view and
                       current browser control are tab stops.
                     - Removed appEvents OnMessage handler. This had been
                       used to active browser control. This is now handled
                       automatically in host frames.
                     - Added new actions to trap Ctrl+Tab and Shift+Ctrl+Tab
                       and switch between tabs in currently active tab set.
                       This means that both tab sets have same response to
                       key presses.
v1.16 of 16 Feb 2007 - Fixed history list bug by clearing history list after
                       updating database.
                     - Also cleared main display while loading updated
                       database to prevent a pre-update routine being
                       selected while display was being redrawn.
v1.17 of 16 Feb 2007 - Changed to work with revised Main Display Manager and

                       updated database is being loaded. Added code to
                       disable main actions when the form is disabled.

                       actTestCompileIndirect back to actTestCompile.
                     - Changed to run compilation in a separate thread via
                       TWaitForActionUI instead of executing action via the
                       class.
                     - Added Update database action that enables database to
                       be loaded while a waiy dialpg box is displayed.
                     - No longer disable form when database re-loading after
                       updating. We display modal dialog instead.

                       required for compatibility with Vista.
v1.30 of 25 Aug 2008 - Code that performs test compile in a thread while
                       displaying a wait dialog was extracted into the
                       UTestCompileUI unit. This new unit improves handling
                       of cases when compiler fails to run.

                     - Corrected routine and class names in assertions.
                     - Made all action update events refer to Sender rather

                       share same event handlers.

v0.3 of 19 Feb 2005  - Refactoring: changed frame to implement the renamed
                       IFrameActionMgr and ICompCheckActionMgr interfaces.
v0.4 of 21 Feb 2005  - Significantly revised method to generating and
                       displaying HTML pages by using new TDetailPageLoader
                       classes.
v0.5 of 22 Feb 2005  - Modified to use new browser external object extender.
                     - A single extender object now supplied to frame by
                       calling its new ISetWBExternal interface) rather than
                       frame owning its own custom extender object.
                     - All support for IFrameActionMgr interfaces deleted
                       since the new extender object handles notification of
                       user-initiated events to the application.
v0.6 of 23 Feb 2005  - Significantly revised to descend from other frames
                       that implement functionality that is common to all
                       detail view frames. This frame now only implements
                       functions specific to the compiler check frame.
v0.7 of 28 Jan 2006  - Added new parameter to TCompCheckFrame.Display to
                       force redisplay of a view item even if it is already

v1.1 of 24 Nov 2006  - Added support for ICompCheckDisplayMgr's new
                       TestUnitVisible property accessors. This code shows
                       and hides test units when routines are displayed.
v1.2 of 26 Nov 2006  - Changed JavaScript call used to toggle visibility of
                       test unit. Required routine renamed from ShowSrc() to

                     - The routine HTML page is now only reloaded if previous
                       page wasn't a routine, otherwise details are displayed
                       dynamically by DHTML object.
                     - Replaced hard-wired code that toggles test unit
                       visibility with a call into DHTML object.
                     - Added code to set CSS specific to compiler check pane.
                     - Added implementation of IDHTMLHostInfo and

                     - Pushed Display method back into base class.
                     - Prevented ShowTestUnit method from setting test unit
                       visibility flag.
v1.7 of 04 Mar 2007  - Fixed bug that was causing showing and hiding of test
                       unit to get out of sync with main menu.

                       to replace those deleted from UDHTML.
                     - Methods that need to dynamically update document in
                       browser control now construct an IDHTML object
                       explicitly now that DHTML property delected.
                     - Made private and protected sections strict.

v0.4 of 20 Feb 2005  - Significantly revised method to generating and
                       displaying HTML pages by using new TDetailPageLoader

v0.5 of 22 Feb 2005  - Modified to use new browser external object extender.
                     - Single extender object now supplied to frame (by
                       calling its new ISetWBExternal interface) rather than
                       frame owning its own custom extender object.
                     - All support for IFrameActionMgr interfaces deleted
                       since the new extender object handles notification of
                       user-initiated events to application.
v0.6 of 23 Feb 2005  - Significantly revised to descend from other frames
                       that implement functionality that is common to all
                       detail view frames. This frame now only implements
                       functions specific to the information frame.

                       document. Uses object in new UWBHighlighter unit to

                       class to enable it to display correct view.
                     - Changed DisplayCurViewItem to override new version in
                       base class to perform any required text search
                       highlighting.
                     - Added code to set CSS specific to information pane.
v1.2 of 04 Feb 2007  - Now uses global query object to find details of
                       current search query rather than use TDetailView
                       object.
                     - Added new parameter to TInfoFrame.Display to force
                       redisplay of view item even if already displayed. This
                       was done to enable pane to highlight or unhilight text
                       search results. We previously used a TDetailView
                       object to do this.
                     - Replaced now redundant TDetailView class references
                       with TViewItem.
v1.3 of 16 Feb 2007  - Revised to work with redefined display interfaces from
                       IntfFrameMgrs.
                     - Pushed Display method back into base class.

v1.4 of 26 Nov 2006  - Changed code that generates JavaScript call that
                       displays a compiler log to use renamed JavaScript
                       function.

                       TTestCompRoutineGenerator and
                       TDbaseCompRoutineGenerator with single
                       TCompRoutineGenerator class that resolves only one
                       placeholder. Remainder of details are updated
                       dynamically.
                     - Updated THTMLGeneratorFactory re changes.

                       reliance on dynamic updating of the generated code.
                     - Now uses routines from UHTMLUtils to generate HTML
                       tags instead of generating from literal strings.
                     - Class structure completely revised.
v2.1 of 16 Jun 2009  - Now calls new TRoutine.CanCompile method instead of
                       defunct TRoutine.StandardFormat property to check if

                       TRoutineCompCheckPageHTML.
                     - Changed TRoutineCompCheckPageHTML to use different
                       templates for when snippet is not compilable or there
                       are no compilers.
                     - Modified TRoutineInfoPageHTML to hide compiler table
                       for non-compilable snippets.

______________________________________________________________________________

v0.1 of 21 Feb 2005  - Original version.
v0.2 of 25 Apr 2005  - Changed to use same welcome page (loaded by
                       TWelcomePageLoader) for both info and compiler check
                       panes when database not empty.
                     - Renamed TInfoWelcomePageLoader class as
                       TWelcomePageLoader now used for both panes.
                     - Deleted redundant TInfoWelcomePageLoader class that
                       was used to load compiler check welcome page.
                     - Changed TWelcomePageLoader to load renamed
                       welcome.html document.
v0.3 of 03 Jun 2005  - Changed to load dynamic pages by first loading a
                       suitable blank document containing required styles and
                       scripts and then inserting code generated using
                       templates into blank document's <body> section. This
                       is done to allow JavaScript to run when scripts are
                       disabled in user's Internet zone. Previous method was
                       to load whole document from stream which made web
                       browser control use security in internet zone.
v1.0 of 24 May 2006  - Improved and corrected comments.
                     - Relocated and rationalised $WARN directives.

                       compiler check pane with single one.
                     - Added new TCompRoutinePageLoader, that loads renamed
                       comp-routine.html, and deleted TCompPageLoader,
                       TCompDBRoutinePageLoader and
                       TCompTestRoutinePageLoader subclasses.
                     - Updated TDetailPageKind enumeration to reflect change
                       from three page kinds to two.
                     - Updated TDetailPageLoaderFactory re changes.
v1.2 of 03 Dec 2006  - Changed TInfoRoutinePageLoader to descend directly
                       from TDynamicPageLoader instead of TInfoPageLoader and
                       made use info-routine.html as its resource document
                       instead of info-blank.html.
                     - Renamed TInfoPageLoader as TInfoRoutineListPageLoader
                       since it is now base class for information pane views
                       that display a table of routines. Made appropriate
                       changes to associated sub-classes.

                       nodata-welcome.html no longer used.
v1.5 of 04 Oct 2008  - Changed TDetailPageLoaderFactory to derive from
                       TNoConstructObject and hence prevented it from being
                       constructed.
                     - Made various protected and private sections strict.
                     - Now use ClassName method in all assert statements.
v2.0 of 25 Jan 2009  - Total rewrite and simplification. Now provides a
                       single static class that ensures a blank HTML document
                       is loaded and modifies body to display HTML generated
                       by a generator object.
                     - Removed TDetailPageLoaderFactory, TDetailPageLoader,
                       TEmptyPageLoader, TStaticPageLoader,
                       TWelcomePageLoader, TCompNAPageLoader,
                       TDynamicPageLoader, TInfoRoutineListPageLoader,
                       TInfoUncatHeaderPageLoader, TInfoCategoryPageLoader,
                       TInfoRoutinePageLoader and TCompRoutinePageLoader

                     - Rewrote TDetailPageLoader and static class.
                     - Removed unnecessary $WARN directive.
                     - Now use only detail-info.html and
                       detail-compcheck.html as base documents.
v2.1 of 16 May 2009  - Removed IDetailViewHostInfo parameter from
                       TDetailPageLoader.LoadPage method.
                     - Removed generators for Uncategorised view type.
                     - Added generators for Alphabet and SnippetsKind view
                       types.
                     - Refactored code into several class methods.

                       updating of routine view in information pane.
                     - Reorganised class heirachy to move code common to
                       information and compiler check classes into base
                       classes. This reorganisation also takes account of
                     - Changed factory class to work with information pane
                       code.
                     - Changed to use new URoutineHTML unit to provide HTML
                       relating to routines for information and compiler
                       check panes. Removed HTML generation code from
                       TCompCheckRoutineInfoDHTML as a result.
v1.2 of 04 Feb 2007  - Replaced redundant TDetailView class references with
                       TViewItem.

                       passing function name and parameters separately.
                     - Changed return type of IDHTMLHostInfo.HTMLDocument to
                       IDispatch.
v1.5 of 14 Sep 2008  - Modified TCompCheckRoutineDHTML to hide toggle test
                       unit visibility and test compile command links when
                       routine is not in standard format.
                     - Made some private and protected class sections strict.

                       create it when required.
                     - Modified TInfoRoutineDHTML to show edit link for user
                       defined routines.
                     - Added TDetailDHTML.SetOnClick method.
v1.6 of 04 Oct 2008  - Changed TDHTMLFactory to derive from

                     - Now use ClassName method in assert statement.
v1.7 of 15 Dec 2008  - Changed to iterate compilers using for..in loops.
v1.8 of 09 Jan 2009  - Added parameter to ICompCheckRoutineDHTML's
                       DisplayCompileResults method to provide reference to
                       compilers object whose results are required. Modified
                       TCompCheckRoutineDHTML implementation accordingly.
                     - Changed TRoutineDetailDHTML to use own instantiation
                       of compilers object for compiler info rather than
                       global compilers singleton. Provides this to sub

                     - Removed warnings about un-fixed interfaces.
v1.1 of 14 Oct 2006  - Removed code that converts unix time stamps from GMT
                       to local time on Windows 9x systems. The code used
                       Windows API routines that are not supported on Windows
                       9x. This means that date checks may be inaccurate on

                       - Removed fSelectedRoutines field and CurrentSearch
                         property: required information now in query object.
                       - Replaced all other references to TDetailView objects
                         with either calls to query object or to TViewItem

v2.0 of 16 Feb 2007  - Major update. Two major changes were:
                       - This TMainDisplayMgr no longer manipulates and
                         interogates the information and compiler check panes
                         of the details frame. TDetailFrame now supports all
                         relevant interfaces and dispatches requests and
                         commands to the relevant child pane. Therefore this
                         code was revised to communicate only with
                         TDetailFrame and TOverviewFrame. All calls that
                         required knowledges of the child panes was changed
                         to make calls on TDetailFrame.
                       - Revised to work with redefined and new display
                         interfaces from IntfFrameMgrs and fact that these
                         interfaces no longer form a heirachy.
                         TMainDisplayMgr casts the managed frames to the
                         appropriate interfaces when calling their methods.
v2.1 of 05 Jun 2008  - Replaced methods use to select tabs in overview and
                       details panes with properties that both select tabs
                       and get index of selected tabs.
                     - Initialisation code no longer selects Information pane
                       but leaves selected pane visible.
v2.2 of 09 Jan 2009  - TMainDisplayMgr.DisplayCompileResults now has a
                       parameter that specifies compilers object whose
                       results are to be displayed.
v2.3 of 06 Jun 2009  - Removed TMainDisplayMgr.ShowTestUnit method.
                     - Added new TMainDisplayMgr UpdateOverviewTreeState and
                       CanUpdateOverviewTreeState methods.

                     - Moved TPreferences to implementation section and
                       changed to descend from TInterfacedObject and
                       implement IPreferences.
                     - Changed private implementation variable to be of
                       IPreferences type.
                     - Changed TPreferences to implement property read/write
                       accessor methods of IPreferences rather than using
                       direct field access.
v1.2 of 29 Oct 2006  - Renamed IPreferences properties:
                       * SnippetCommentStyle to SourceCommentStyle,
                       * SnippetSyntaxHilited to SourceSyntaxHilited
                       * SnippetDefaultFileExt to SourceDefaultFileType.
                     - SourceDefaultFileType property changed to return an
                       enumeration rather than a file extension. NOTE: this
                       breaks compatibility of persistent storage produced by
                       CodeSnip v1.0.3 and earlier.
v2.0 of 07 Sep 2007  - Major revision:
                     - Added ability to get a non-persisting copy of
                       singleton to use for temporary preference updates.
                       This was done by splitting implementation into two
                       classes, one that persists (for singletion) and one
                       that does not. Added Clone and Assign methods to
                       enable singlton to create a temp copy of itself and to
                       assign modified temp data to itself.
                     - Added new MeasurementUnits, PrinterOptions and
                       PrinterPageMargins properties.
                     - Changed to write to various sub sections of
                       ssPreferences settings key. NOTE: this breaks
                       compatibility with persistent storage produced by
                       CodeSnip v1.6.4 and earlier.
v2.1 of 17 Oct 2007  - Added HiliteAttrs property and code to support
                       persisting syntax highlighter information to
                       ssPreferences settings kye. NOTE: this breaks
                       compatibility with persistent storage produced by
                       CodeSnip v1.7.4 and earlier.
v2.2 of 04 Nov 2007  - Changed parameter type of TPreferences.Assign from
                       IAssignable to IInterface.
v2.3 of 16 Dec 2008  - Modified to user TPageMargins constructor instead of
                       deleted PageMargins function to initialise margins.
                     - Made TPreferences fields strict protected instead of
                       private
                     - Moved construction and storage of IPreferences
                       singleton into TPreferences. Preferences function now
                       calls into TPreferences to get reference to singleton.
                     - Move some constants into TPreferencesPersist class.

v1.2 of 16 Dec 2008  - Changed to use user-defined highlighter when syntax
                       highlighting of source code is required. Always uses

                     - Moved code from THTTPProtocolHandler and
                       TShellExecProtocolHandler to new UHTTProtocol unit

                     - Removed now unused TExecuteProtocolHandler class.
                     - Renamed TProtocolHandlerFactory as TProtocolFactory.
                     - Added new TProtocolRegistrar and TProtocolRegisterItem

                       along with private singleton instance of
                       TProtocolRegistrar.
                     - Changed TProtocolHandlerFactory to work with
                       registered protocol classes rather than hard wired
                       protocol classes. This lets new protocols be added
                       without modifying this unit.
v2.1 of 04 Nov 2007  - Removed redundant uses clause reference to removed
                       UHelpTopicAction unit along with other unused units.
v2.2 of 04 Oct 2008  - Changed TProtocolFactory to derive from
                       TNoConstructObject and hence prevented it from being
                       constructed.
                     - Made private and protected sections of various classes
                       strict.

                       overwriting manually to account for files without

v1.3 of 29 May 2008  - Fixed bug that caused dialog box to always set default
                       file extension.
                     - Also changed so that UseSyntaxHiliting propery value
                       only depends on state of check box without reference
                       to whether it is enabled.

                     - Fixed bug that could wrongly detect an existing file

                       ISnippets type.
                     - Changed TSnippets to implement property read / write
                       accessor methods of ISnippets rather than using direct
                       field access.
v1.2 of 24 Aug 2008  - Added Windows unit to enable inlining in Delphi 2006.

                         now exposes editing facilities via the ISnippetsEdit
                         interface.
                       - Added numerous record and interface types to

                         routines in list and another that counts routines in
                         user or main databases.
v2.1 of 19 Sep 2008  - Modified routine update and deletion methods of
                       ISnippetsEdit to update Depends and XRef properties of

                       of routines that depend on and cross reference a
                       specified routine.
v2.2 of 21 Sep 2008  - Improved speed of routine searches in routine list by
                       changing to use binrary search.

______________________________________________________________________________

v0.1 of 17 Mar 2005  - Original version. This is a reworking of earlier
                       syntax highlighter implementation in the former
                       UBaseHiliter and UDetailHTMLHiliter units.
v0.2 of 21 Apr 2005  - Added new IntfHilite unit that contains type
                       declarations formerly in other units.
v0.3 of 04 Jun 2005  - Changed invalid default font in
                       TXHTMLHiliter.GetMainCSSStyle from mono to monospace.

                     - Localised literal HTML document title string.
v1.1 of 07 Nov 2006  - Changed to use UCSSUtils methods to generate CSS
                       attributes.
                     - Completely rewrote RTF hiliter using new TRTFBuilder
                       class. Also changed class to generate smaller RTF
                       code.
                     - Changed reference to fAttrs private field of parent
                       class to reference to protected Attrs property in
                       TXHTMLHiliter.
v1.2 of 25 Nov 2006  - Changed to use new THiliterCSS class to handle CSS
                       generation and class names. As a result removed all
                       explicit CSS generation and interogation code from
                       this unit.
                     - Pushed BeforeElem() and AfterElem() methods from
                       TDetailHTMLHiliter and TCHTMLHiliter up into super
                       class TBaseHTMLHiliter. This leaves TDetailHTMLHiliter
                       as an empty class that is retained for informational
                       purposes.
                     - TBaseHTMLHiliter now takes note of provided
                       highlighter class when determining which highlighter
                       elements are formatted. This means that
                       TDetailHTMLHighlighter also now requires a suitable
                       highlighter object. (Previously it ignored any
                       highlighter and CSS classes were hard wired).
v1.3 of 03 Dec 2006  - TDetailHTMLHighlighter changed to surround generated
                       HTML in <pre>..</pre> tags. This means that
                       TDetailHTMLHighlighter is no longer an empty class.
v1.4 of 02 Jul 2007  - Added support for document titles where document type
                       supports this.
                     - Changed XHTML code generation to use THTMLBuilder.

                       TNoConstructObject and hence prevented it from being
                       constructed.
                     - Made some private and protected sections of some
                       classes strict.

                     - Changed to call ICompiler object to tidy binary files

                       rather than a thread. TWaitForUIAction actually

                       can be compared and implicitly converted from a
                       TPJVersionInfo record and to and from strings.
                     - Removed TVersionInfo.StrToVerNumber and
                       TVersionInfo,VerNumberToStr. Now use implicit and
                       explicit conversions of TVersionNumber instead.

UWaitForActionUI.pas
______________________________________________________________________________

v1.0 of 01 Dec 2006  - Original version.
v1.1 of 05 Feb 2007  - Added new static Run method to TWaitForActionUI.
                     - Fixed bug in TWaitForActionUI.Pause that was freezing
                       program if PauseBeforeDisplay was not multiple of 10.
v1.2 of 01 Mar 2007  - Added new overloaded TWaitForActionUI.Run method that
                       can execute a thread instead of an action. We use new
                       TOwnedAction private class to do this.
                     - Fixed possible bug in TWaitForActionUI that fails to
                       close dialog if MinDisplayTime is zero.
                     - Changed TActionThread to descend from TThreadEx and
                       removed TActionThread's own Completed property in
                       favour of property of same name in new base class.
v1.3 of 24 Sep 2007  - Replaced call to Sleep routine in pause processing
                       with busy wait. This fixed bug that was freezing whole
                       system and therefore not displaying wait form.
v1.4 of 29 Oct 2007  - Made form closure thread safe so that timer and thread
                       cannot both access at same time. This was done to try
                       to fix occasional bug where dialog box never closes.
v1.5 of 02 Jun 2008  - Rewrote code from v1.4 to make form opening / closure
                       thread safe. Now use critical section rather than lock
                       count. Previous fix did not work.
v1.6 of 04 Oct 2008  - Made TWaitForActionUI constructor protected, Execute
                       method protected, one overloaded version of Run method
                       call other one and removed unused public properties.
                       static.
                     - Modified TOwnedAction to work with revised
                       TThreadWrapper class that can now only be accessed via
                       a static Execute method.
                     - Made all private and protected sections strict.
                     - Now use ClassName method in all assert statements.
v1.7 of 15 Dec 2008  - Changed TWaitForActionUI.Pause to call UUtils.Pause.
v1.8 of 11 Jan 2009  - Removed TWaitForActionUI.Run method overload that
                       takes a thread as a parameter. This caused thread to
                       be run in a second thread which is not required.
                     - Removed now unused private TOwnedAction class.

v0.2 of 25 Apr 2005  - Implemented new HelpTopic and ConfigCompilers methods
                       of IWBExternal by calling methods of same names in

                     - Relocated and rationalised $WARN directives.

                       static class rather than direct.
                     - Changed to use renamed IntfExternalObj unit (was
                       previously CodeSnip_TLB).
v1.1 of 23 Nov 2006  - Added ToggleTestUnit method and implemented by calling
                       equivalent method in notifier object.

                       IWBExternal.
v1.2 of 04 Nov 2007  - Changed to implement IWBExternal3 instead of
                       IWBExternal2 and removed HelpTopic method as
                       consequence.
v1.3 of 14 Sep 2008  - Changed to implement IWBExternal4 instead of

                       - Changed signature of DisplayRoutine and modified the
                         implementation to call the equivalent modified
                         notifier method.
                       - Added new EditRoutine method that calls method of
                         same name in Notifier.
v1.4 of 17 Jun 2009  - Changed to implement IWBExternal5 instead of
                       IWBExternal4:
                       - ShowTestUnit method replaces ToggleTestUnit.
                       - Donate method added.

                     - Changed to use TWBHelper to wait for document to load
