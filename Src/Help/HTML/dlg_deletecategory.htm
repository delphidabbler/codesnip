    <p>
      This dialog is used to delete a user-defined category from the database.
      It is accessed from the <em>Database | Delete Category</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="warning">Warning:</span> Deleting a category that contains
      snippets also deletes all those snippets from the database. The dialog box
      will warn you if this is about to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the category to be deleted from the list box. then click
      <em>Delete</em> to delete it. If the category contains any snippets a
      dialog box will be displayed that asks you to confirm you wish to delete
      the category and all its snippets. Click <em>Yes</em> to confirm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Delete</em> button will be disabled if you haven't selected a
      category from the list box.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have noticed that some user defined categories do not appear in
      the list of categories to be deleted. This is because some categories are
      required by <em>CodeSnip</em> and cannot be deleted, although they can be
      renamed.
