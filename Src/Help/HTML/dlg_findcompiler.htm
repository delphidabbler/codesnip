      <a name="dlg_findcompiler"></a>Find Compiler(s) Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box enables snippets to be searched for by their
      relationship with various compilers. It is accessed from the <em>Search |
      Find Compiler(s)</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue works by applying a search criteria to any or all of a
      selection of compilers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose the compiler or compilers you wish to test against by ticking those
      required in the <em>Compilers</em> check list. Use the <em>Select All</em>
      and <em>Clear All</em> buttons to set or clear all check marks. You must
      choose at least one compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next you select the compile results you wish to search on in the
      <em>Criteria</em> drop down list. The possible results are:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        <em>Compiles</em> - finds snippets that compile OK, with or without
        warnings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Compiles with no warnings</em> - finds snippets that compile
        without warnings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Compiles with warnings</em> - finds snippets that compile with
        warnings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Does not compile</em> - finds snippets that do not compile.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Not tested</em> - finds snippets that have not been tested.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now choose whether to search for snippets that match the specified
      compile results for any or all compilers. Do this by selecting the
      required radio button in the <em>Search logic</em> group box.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may apply the search across the whole database or, if you have run
      another search, searching only the snippets selected by the previous
      search, and so refining that search. The <em>Search scope</em> group box
      is used to decide which course of action to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose to search the whole database any previous search is
      abandoned before this search is run. This means that if no snippets are
      found matching your search criteria, the previous search is lost and the
      whole database will be selected. On the other hand if you choose to refine
      the previous search and this search fails to find any snippets, the
      earlier search remains unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Search scope</em> group box is disabled if there was no existing
      search when this dialogue box was opened, and the search operates on the
      entire database.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Examples
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Example 1
    </h3>
    <p>
      Suppose you have Delphi 7, Delphi 2006 and Delphi 2010 available and you
      want to find the snippets that will compile on at least one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      First clear any existing selections in the <em>Compilers</em> list box
      (press <em>Clear all</em> then place a tick next to each of the three
      compilers). Now select <em>Compiles</em> in the <em>Criteria</em> drop
      down list and choose <em>Find any compiler</em> in the <em>Search
      logic</em> box. If you have existing search results displayed in the main
      window select <em>Search the whole database</em> in the <em>Search
      scope</em> box and then press <em>OK</em> to run the search. The results
      will appear in the main window.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Example 2
    </h3>
    <p>
      You now want to know which of the snippets you found earlier will not
      compile on both Delphi XE and XE2. Keep the previous search and open the
      dialogue box again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue box will have remembered details of your previous search,
      so deselect Delphi 7, 2006 2010 and select Delphi XE and XE2 in the
      <em>Compilers</em> list. Now choose <em>Does not compile</em> in the
      <em>Criteria</em> drop down list and change the search logic to <em>Find
      all compilers</em>. Ensure that <em>Refine existing search</em> scope is
      selected and press <em>OK</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You initial search will now be refined to show only those snippets that
      compile on one of Delphi 7, 2006 and 2010 but fail to compile on both
      Delphi XE and XE2.
