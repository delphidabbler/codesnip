      <em>CodeSnip</em> is more than just a simple repository for your code
      snippets, it can do some other things like create compilable units and
      test-compile your code that mean it needs to know something about your
      code. For that reason each snippet must be identified as one of four
      kinds, and there are rules governing the layout of the source code. The
      four kinds are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A <em>routine</em><br>
        This is simple function or procedure, not a method.<br>
        <a href="snippet_routine.htm">Learn more</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <em>type definition</em><br>
        This is a basic type definition, not a class, object or one of the 
        extended records containing methods that are supported in later Delphis.
        <br>
        <a href="snippet_type.htm">Learn more</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <em>constant definition</em><br>
        This is what it says &ndash; a definition of one or more constants or
        typed constants.<br>
        <a href="snippet_constant.htm">Learn more</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Freeform code</em><br>
        A catch all for any snippets that is not one of the above types. Can
        contain anything. Freeform code can't be included in a
        generated unit and nether can it be test complied.<br>
        <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">Learn more</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If you want to be able use all of <em>CodeSnip</em>'s functionality you
      must designate each of your snippets as one of the the first three kinds.
      Use the &quot;learn more&quot; links to find out what you need to do to
      comply with the requirements. Another way to learn is to examine the code
      from the main database, since it all conforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand if you only want to use <em>CodeSnip</em> as a
      repository for your code snippets, just designate everything as freeform.
      Or mix and match.
    </p>
