    </h1>
    <p>
      A simple type definition snippet, unsurprisingly, defines one or more
      Pascal types. Only simple types are supported. Classes, objects and
      records that contain methods are not: use
      <a href="snippet_class.htm">class &amp; advanced record</a> snippet kinds
      for those. If you're not sure, the only types supported are those that can
      be completely defined in the interface section of a unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each type definition snippet must begin with the <strong>type</strong>
      keyword as the first non-space text in the source code. Comments may not
      preceed it. The <strong>type</strong> keyword is followed by at least one
      space or newline and then one or more type definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an example of a valid type definition:
    </p>
<pre class="source-code">type
  TMyType = 1..20;
  TMySecondType = array[TMyType] of Integer;</pre>
    <p>
      Simple type definitions may refer to other simple type definitions,
      <a href="snippet_class.htm">class &amp; advanced record</a> type
      definitions or <a href="snippet_constant.htm">constants</a>, providing
      they are defined in Delphi units or elsewhere in the database. The
      snippet's units and dependencies references should indicate where to find
      the other types and constants. Type definitions must not reference
      <a href="snippet_routine.htm">routine</a>,
      <a href="snippet_unit.htm">unit</a> or
      <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">freeform</a> snippets.
