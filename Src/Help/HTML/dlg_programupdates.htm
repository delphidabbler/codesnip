      Check For Program Updates Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is displayed when the <em>Tools | Check For Program
      Updates</em> menu option is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the dialogue box appears the DelphiDabbler web site is
      contacted to find out if any new versions of <em>CodeSnip</em> are
      available. &quot;Checking...&quot; is displayed while this is in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a new version is available then a button is displayed that, when
      clicked, uses your default web browser to download a zip file containing
      the latest version of <em>CodeSnip</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>. You can then
      close <em>CodeSnip</em> and install the updated program from the installer
      contained in the zip file.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is no new version<sup>&Dagger;</sup>, a message is displayed to
      that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      &dagger; Should a download fail you can also get the latest version from
      <em>CodeSnip</em>'s <a
        href="http://delphidabbler.com/url/codesnip-download"
        class="weblink"
        target="_blank"
      >download web page</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      &Dagger; Only stable releases of <em>CodeSnip</em> are made available via
      this dialogue box. If you are interested trying any pre-release or beta
      versions, please check the <em>CodeSnip</em> <a
        href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/codesnip/releases"
        class="weblink"
        target="_blank"
      >Releases</a> page on GitHub which lists all releases.
    </p>
    <p class="bordered">
      By default <em>CodeSnip</em> performs a check for program updates
      automatically from time to time. A pop-up notification window is displayed
      in the main window if an update is available. The notification includes
      a button that causes the update to be downloaded via the default browser,
      in an exactly similar way to this dialogue box. You can switch this
      automatic checking feature off, or change the frequency with which checks
      are made, by using the <a
        href="dlg_prefs_updates.htm"
      >Updates</a> tab of the <a
        href="dlg_preferences.htm"
      >Preferences</a> dialogue box.
