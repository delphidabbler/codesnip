    <p>
      This tab of the <a href="dlg_preferences.htm">Preferences</a> dialog box
      is used to customise the source code emitted by the code generator for
      test compilations and generated units.
    <p>
      The tab is accessed by selecting the <em>Tools | Preferences</em> menu
      item then clicking the <em>Code Generation</em> tab.
      <strong>Note:</strong> This tab is not used to modify the <em>style</em>
      of the source code: use the <a href="dlg_prefs_sourcecode.htm">Code
      Formatting</a> tab to change the style.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Code Generator can be configured to generate compiler directives to
      inhibit specified warning messages for Delphi 6 and later.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enable this facility you must first check the <em>Emit $WARN directives
      to switch off listed warnings</em> check box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warnings to be silenced are those listed in the list view control
      below the check box. Warnings are identified by the text in the
      <em>Symbol</em> column. These symbols must be valid parameters for
      Delphi's $WARN directive. Since new symbols can be (and are) introduced in
      different versions of Delphi, the minimum version of the compiler that
      supports the warning must also be specified. This is shown in the
      <em>Min. Compiler</em> column of the list view. The version is that
      specified by the Delphi's <var>CompilerVersion</var> constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      New symbols can be added and existing symbols updated or deleted by using
      the controls below the list view as follows:
    </p>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        <strong>Add a symbol</strong><br>
        Enter the symbol in the <em>Symbol</em> edit control and specify the
        earliest compiler that supports it in the <em>Min. Compiler</em> edit
        control. If the symbol is not already listed and the compiler version
        is valid then the <em>Add</em> button will be enabled. Click the button
        to add the symbol to the list.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Delete a symbol</strong><br>
        Select the required symbol in the list view then click the
        <em>Delete</em> button. The symbol will be removed from the list.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Update a symbol</strong><br>
        Select the symbol to be updated from the list view. It's details will be
        copied into the <em>Symbol</em> and <em>Min. Compiler</em> edit
        controls. Change the details using the edit controls then click the
        <em>Update</em> button to modify the symbol. The changes will be
        reflected in the list view. If the modified symbol already exists or if
        the minimum compiler version is not valid then the <em>Update</em>
        button will be disabled.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <em>Pre-defined</em> button next to the <em>Min. Compiler</em> edit
      control is provided to make it easier to choose the required compiler
      version. Clicking the button drops down a menu which displays the names
      of some Delphi compilers. Choosing a compiler will enter the correct
      version number in the edit control. <strong>Note:</strong> The earliest
      supported compiler version is 14.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Preview</em> button at the top right of the tab displays the
      source code that will be emitted by the code generator.
