      Edit Snippet Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box is displayed when either the <em>Database | Add
      Snippet</em> or <em>Database | Edit Snippet</em> menu options are
      selected. It is used to enter details of a new user defined code snippet
      or to edit the details of an existing user-defined snippet.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a new snippet is being added all controls are blank or set to default
      values. When an existing snippet is being edited the controls are
      populated with the snippet's existing properties.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Editing the snippet
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dialog has multiple tabs. All but the <em>Code</em> tab are optional
      &ndash; others can be used to provide additional information about the
      snippet. However, if you plan to test compile the snippet you must ensure
      that the snippet's dependencies and units are properly set up on the
      <em>References</em> tab.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Code Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      This tab gathers all the information to uniquely define a snippet. All the
      fields are required. They are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Source code</em> text box.
        </div>
        <div>
          Enter the snippet's source code here. The format of the code is
          important unless you are using the freeform snippet kind.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Kind</em> drop down list.
        </div>
        <div>
          Select the <a href="snippet_kinds.htm">kind of snippet</a> you are
          editing.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Description</em> edit box.
        </div>
        <div>
          Enter a description of the code snippet here. This field should not
          contain &quot;}&quot; characters since the field's text is used in
          comments in exported Pascal code and the &quot;}&quot; character will
          terminate the comment early.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Name</em> edit box.
        </div>
        <div>
          Give the code snippet a name here. Names must be valid Pascal
          identifiers with the added restriction that they must start with one
          of the English letters 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z' or the underscore character.
          Names must also be unique within the user database, although they may
          duplicate names in the main database.
        </div>
        <div>
          It is customary to name functions or procedures using the routine's
          name. Overloaded routines are often named by suffixing the routine
          name with '_A', '_B' etc.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Category</em> drop down list.
        </div>
        <div>
          Select the category to which the snippet belongs.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      References Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      Use this tab to specify the snippets and units that are associated with
      the snippet being edited. If it is intended to test compile the snippet
      then the <em>Dependencies</em> and <em>Units</em> list boxes must be
      completed if the snippet depends on a Delphi unit or if it uses another
      snippet from the database.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Cross-references</em> check list box.
        </div>
        <div>
          Use this list to specify any other snippets to be cross-referenced
          from this snippet. Check the boxes next to desired snippets. Cross
          references are for information only. All snippets are listed.
        </div>
        <div>
          User defined snippets are displayed in blue.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Dependencies</em> check list box.
        </div>
        <div>
          Specify any other snippets that this snippet depends upon by checking
          the boxes next to the desired snippets. If this snippet is to be test
          compiled then any other snippets it requires must be specified here or
          the test compile will fail. The available entries in this list box
          will vary according to the <a href="snippet_kinds.htm">snippet
          kind</a>.
        </div>
        <div>
          Routine snippets are not included in this list if the snippet being
          edited is a constant or type definition.
          <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">Freeform</a> snippets are never
          included in this list.
        </div>
        <div>
          User defined snippets are displayed in blue.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>View Dependencies</em> button.
        </div>
        <div>
          Click this button to see all dependencies for the snippet being edited
          in the <a href="dlg_dependencies.htm">Dependencies dialog box</a>. All
          entries checked in the <em>Dependencies</em> list box are included,
          along with all their dependencies, and so on. You must not create a
          circular dependency; the <em>Dependencies</em> dialog box will help
          you detect them.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Units</em> check list box.
        </div>
        <div>
          Select any units that this snippet requires in order to compile.
          Required units must be specified if test compilation is to be
          attempted. A selection of common units is provided, along with any
          units already associated with the snippet. More units can be added to
          the list &ndash; see below.
        </div>
        <div>
          Units are &quot;used&quot; in the order they appear in the list. If
          this order causes namespace clashes you should prefix ambiguous
          identifiers in the source code with the unit name, e.g.
          <code>Graphics.TBitmap</code>.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong class="warning">NOTE:</strong> If you intend to test compile
          your snippet with Delphi XE2 to XE5 you will need to make sure it
          is configured to search the namespaces containing the units you list
          here. Do this in the <a href="dlg_configcompilers.htm">Configure
          Compilers</a> dialogue box. Use the <em>Command Line</em> tab to enter
          an <code>-NS</code> &quot;switch&quot; that has a semi-colon separated
          list of namespaces appended to it. For example
          <code>-NSSystem;WinAPI</code> causes the compiler to search the
          <var>System</var> and <var>WinAPI</var> namespaces. You can see a list
          of namespaces with the units they contain in the <a
            href="http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/Unit_Scope_Names"
            class="weblink"
            target="_blank"
          >Unit Scope Names</a> topic of the Embarcadero RADStudio
          documentation.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Add Unit</em> edit box and button.
        </div>
        <div>
          If additional units are required in the <em>Units</em> check list box
          type the name of the unit in the edit box and click the <em>Add
          Unit</em> button. The unit will be added to the <em>Units</em> check
          list box and its check box will be checked.
        </div>
       </li>
    </ul>
   <h3>
      Extra Information Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      This tab is used to provide additional descriptive information about the
      snippet. Information can be specified using a simple markup language
      called <a href="reml.htm">REML</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Compile Results Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      Use this tab to specify any known compiler results for the snippet. You
      can specify the required compiler in several ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Manually, one compiler at a time using the <em>Set a compile
        results</em> list box. Click the drop down button next to the required
        compiler then choose the required compile result from the drop down
        menu, i.e. one of <em>Success</em>, <em>Warning</em>, <em>Error</em> and
        <em>Unknown</em>. To use the keyboard to modify compile results proceed
        as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Move the keyboard focus to the list box using the
            <span class="smallcaps">Tab</span> key.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select the required compiler using the
            <span class="smallcaps">Up</span> and
            <span class="smallcaps">Down</span> keys.
          </li>
          <li>
            Press <span class="smallcaps">Space</span> to drop down the menu.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select the required result with the
            <span class="smallcaps">Up</span> and
            <span class="smallcaps">Down</span> keys.
          </li>
          <li>
            Press <span class="smallcaps">Enter</span> to select the compile
            result or <span class="smallcaps">Cancel</span> to abort.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <em>Set All To Success</em> button to set every compiler's
        result to &quot;success&quot; (green LED).
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <em>Set All To Query</em> button to set every compiler's
        result &quot;query&quot; (grey LED).
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          Use the <em>Test Compile</em> button to compile the snippet and set
          the compile results accordingly. This button is disabled if no
          compilers are configured or if the snippet is
          <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">freeform</a>.
        </div>
        <div>
          If one or more compilers report warnings or errors, a link appears
          below the <em>Test Compile</em> button that can be clicked to display
          details of the warnings or errors.
        </div>
        <div>
          You can display the unit used to perform the test compilation by
          clicking the <em>View Test Unit</em> button. This can be useful when
          tracking down errors.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Commiting the edit
    </h2>
    <p>
      Clicking <em>OK</em> causes the edited snippet to be validated. If an
      error is found the control where the error is located is selected and an
      error message is displayed. If the snippet is valid the dialog box closes
      and the user database is updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>Cancel</em> to abort the edit.
