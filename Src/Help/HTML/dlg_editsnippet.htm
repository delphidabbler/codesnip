      Edit Snippet Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is displayed when either the <em>Snippets | New
      Snippet</em> or <em>Snippets | Edit Snippet</em> menu options are
      selected. It is used to enter details of a new user-defined code snippet
      or to edit the details of an existing user-defined snippet.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a new snippet is being added all controls are blank or set to default
      values. When an existing snippet is being edited the controls are
      populated with the snippet's existing properties.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Editing the snippet
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dialogue has multiple tabs. All but the <em>Code</em> tab are
      optional: they are used to enter additional information that can be useful
      but is not required. However, if you plan to test compile a Pascal snippet
      you must ensure that the snippet's dependencies are properly set up on the
      <em>References</em> tab.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Code Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      This tab gathers all the information needed to define a snippet. All the
      fields except <em>Display Name</em> are required. They are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Name</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter a name for the snippet in the edit box. The name must be a valid
          Unicode Pascal identifier. It must also be unique within the user
          database, although it may duplicate names in the main database.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is customary to name functions or procedures using the routine's
          name. Overloaded routines are often named by suffixing the routine
          name with '_A', '_B', '_C' and so on.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Display Name</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter a display name for the snippet. When present this name will be
          displayed in the main display instead of the name entered above. The
          display name may contain any Unicode character and does not need to be
          unique.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an optional entry. If it is not supplied the value of the
          <em>Name</em> control is used as the display name.
        </p>
        <p>
          The display name is useful where the entry in the <em>Name</em> field
          does not display well. For example overloaded snippets named
          &quot;Foo&quot; may have names &quot;Foo_A&quot;, &quot;Foo_B&quot;,
          &quot;Foo_C&quot; etc., which are not too friendly. To improve this
          you could use display names like &quot;Foo (Integer overload)&quot;,
          &quot;Foo (string overload)&quot;, &quot;Foo (Integer,string
          overload)&quot; etc.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Description</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter a description of the code snippet in the
          <a href="markup_editor.htm">markup editor</a>. More than one paragraph
          of text can be used. You can enter either plain text or text formatted
          using <em>CodeSnip</em>'s <a href="reml.htm">REML</a> markup language.
        </p>
        <p>
          The description field should not contain &quot;}&quot; characters
          since the field's text may be enclosed in comments in exported Pascal
          code and the &quot;}&quot; character will terminate the comment early.
        </p>
        <p>
          The description can be previewed using the <em>Preview</em> button.
          Clicking this button also validates markup if you have used it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Kind</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Select the <a href="snippet_kinds.htm">kind of snippet</a> from the
          drop down list.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Category</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Select the category to which the snippet belongs from the drop down
          list.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Source code</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter the snippet's source code in this text box. The format of the
          source code is important unless you are using the freeform snippet
          kind. <a
            href="snippet_kinds.htm"
          >Learn more</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Syntax highlight this snippet as Pascal code</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Tick this box if your snippet is written in Pascal and you would like
          the source to be syntax highlighted. Otherwise clear the box. Note
          that the built in highlighter only understands Pascal code and will
          not render code in other languages correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you prefer to turn off syntax highlighting completely go to the <a
            href="dlg_prefs_hiliter.htm"
          >Syntax Highlighter</a> tab of the <a
            href="dlg_preferences.htm"
          >Preferences</a> dialogue box, click the <em>Use Predefined
          Styles</em> button and select the <em>No Highliter</em> option.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      References Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      Use this tab to specify the snippets and units that are associated with
      the snippet being edited. If it is intended to test compile the snippet
      then the <em>Dependencies</em> and <em>Units</em> list boxes must be
      completed correctly whenever the snippet depends on a Delphi unit or if it
      relies upon another snippet from the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      The available controls are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Cross-references</em> list box
        </p>
        <p>
          Use this list box to specify any other snippets to be cross-referenced
          from this snippet. Check the boxes next to the desired snippets. Cross
          references are for information only. All snippets are listed, except
          for the one being edited.
        </p>
        <p>
          To deselect all cross-references right click the list box and select
          the <em>Deselect All Cross-References</em> option from the context
          menu.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Dependencies</em> list box
        </p>
        <p>
          Specify any other snippets that this snippet depends upon by checking
          the boxes next to the desired snippets in this list box. If this
          snippet is to be test compiled then any other snippets it requires
          must be specified here or the test compile will fail. The exception is
          that <a href="snippet_unit.htm">unit snippets</a> never have any
          dependencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          To deselect all dependencies right click the list box and select the
          <em>Deselect All Dependencies</em> option from the context menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use the context menu to see all dependencies for the
          snippet being edited. This information is displayed in the
          <a href="dlg_dependencies_edit.htm">Dependencies dialogue box</a>.
          All entries checked in the <em>Dependencies</em> list box are
          included, along with all their own dependencies, and so on. You must
          not create a circular dependency; the <em>Dependencies</em> dialogue
          box will help you detect them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The available snippets in this list box will vary according to the
          <a href="snippet_kinds.htm">snippet kind</a>. For example,
          <a href="snippet_constant.htm">constant snippets</a> can't depend on
          <a href="snippet_routine.htm">routine</a> snippets and <a href="snippet_unit.htm">unit snippets</a> can't depend on anything, so the
          list will be empty. <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">Freeform</a>
          snippets are never included in the list.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Units</em> list box
        </p>
        <p>
          Use this list box to select any units that this snippet requires in
          order to compile. Required units must be specified if test compilation
          is to be attempted. A selection of common units is provided, along
          with any units already associated with the snippet.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the unit you need is not in the list box, simply enter its name in
          the edit box next to the <em>Add Unit</em> button and click the
          button.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each unit you use is remembered and will appear in the list box in
          future. If the list box is getting too full you can remove most units
          by right clicking them and selecting <em>Delete Selected Unit</em>
          from the context menu. Note that the <code>SysUtils</code>,
          <code>Classes</code>, <code>Windows</code> and <code>Graphics</code>
          units cannot be deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list box's context menu also gives options to restore the unit
          list to it's &quot;factory&quot; default and to deselect all the units
          in the list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Units are &quot;used&quot; in the order they appear in the list. If
          this ordering causes namespace clashes you should prefix ambiguous
          identifiers in the source code with the unit name, e.g.
          <code>Graphics.TBitmap</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you intend to test compile your snippet with Delphi XE2 or later
          you will need to make sure the appropriate compiler is configured to
          search the namespaces containing the units you list here. Do this
          using the <em>Namespaces</em> tab of the
          <a href="dlg_configcompilers.htm">Configure Compilers</a> dialogue
          box. You need to do this for each compiler separately. You can
          find a list of namespaces and the units they contain in the
          <a
            href="http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/Unit_Scope_Names"
            class="weblink"
            target="_blank"
          >Unit Scope Names</a> topic of the Embarcadero RADStudio
          documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any unit is not part of the Delphi RTL or VCL you will need to let
          the compiler know where to find the unit. Use the <em>Search
          Paths</em> tab of the <a href="dlg_configcompilers.htm">Configure
          Compilers</a> dialogue box to specify the required path. You need to
          do this for each compiler separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Notes:</strong> <a href="snippet_unit.htm">Unit snippets</a>
          must declare their used units in the unit source code, so this list
          box is disabled when the snippet kind is <em>unit</em>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Extra Information Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      This tab is used to provide additional descriptive information about the
      snippet. Use it for information that supplements the snippet's
      description or for crediting authors etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter the required information in the <em>Extra information</em>
      <a href="markup_editor.htm">markup editor</a>. You can enter either plain
      text or text formatted using <em>CodeSnip</em>'s
      <a href="reml.htm">REML</a> markup language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information can be previewed using the <em>Preview</em> button.
      Clicking this button also validates markup if you have used it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Compile Results Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      Use this tab to specify any known compilation results for the snippet. You
      can specify such results in several ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Manually, one compiler at a time using the <em>Set compile
          results</em> list box. Click the drop down button next to the required
          compiler then choose a compilation result from the drop down
          menu, i.e. one of <em>Success</em>, <em>Warning</em>, <em>Error</em>
          and <em>Unknown</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use the keyboard to modify compile results proceed as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Move the keyboard focus to the list box using the
            <span class="smallcaps">Tab</span> key.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select the required compiler using the
            <span class="smallcaps">Up</span> and
            <span class="smallcaps">Down</span> keys.
          </li>
          <li>
            Press <span class="smallcaps">Space</span> to drop down the menu.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select the required result with the
            <span class="smallcaps">Up</span> and
            <span class="smallcaps">Down</span> keys.
          </li>
          <li>
            Press <span class="smallcaps">Enter</span> to select the compile
            result or <span class="smallcaps">Cancel</span> to abort.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <em>Set All To Success</em> button to set every compiler's
        result to &quot;success&quot; (green LED).
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <em>Set All To Query</em> button to set every compiler's
        result &quot;query&quot; (grey LED).
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use the <em>Test Compile</em> button to compile the snippet and set
          the compile results automatically. This button is disabled if no
          compilers are configured or if the snippet is
          <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">freeform</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one or more compilers report warnings or errors, a link appears
          below the <em>Test Compile</em> button that can be clicked to display
          details of the warnings or errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can display the unit used to perform the test compilation by
          clicking the <em>View Test Unit</em> button. This can be useful when
          tracking down errors.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Commiting the edit
    </h2>
    <p>
      Clicking <em>OK</em> causes the edited snippet to be validated. If an
      error is found the control where the error is located is selected and an
      error message is displayed. If the snippet is valid the dialogue box
      closes and the user database is updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>Cancel</em> to abort the edit.
