    </h1>
    <p>
      You can export user defined snippets from your database in a format you
      can send to other <em>CodeSnip</em> users who can then import them into
      their user-defined database.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the <em>Snippets | Export Snippets</em> menu option to create an
      export file and use the <em>Snippets | Import Snippets</em> menu item to
      import a file someone else has sent you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imported snippets will be located in the user-defined &quot;Imported
      Snippets&quot; category. They can be moved to other categories by opening
      each snippet in the <a href="dlg_editsnippet.htm">snippets editor</a> and
      changing its category there.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a separate snippets databases maintained by different major
      versions of <em>CodeSnip</em>, say by v3 and v4, you can export snippets
      from the older version and import the files into the newer version,
      <strong>but not the reverse</strong>.
