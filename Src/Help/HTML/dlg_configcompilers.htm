       class="glyph"> Configure Compilers Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box is used to let <em>CodeSnip</em> know about the Pascal
      Compilers that are installed on the system. It is displayed using the
      <em>Tools | Configure Compilers</em> menu option. <em>CodeSnip</em> uses
      these compilers when <a href="about_compiler_checks.htm">test
      compiling</a> routines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supported compilers are listed on the left hand side of the dialog. If a
      compiler is known to <em>CodeSnip</em> its name appears in bold. Unknown
      compilers (or compilers that are not installed on the local system)
      appear in plain text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any changes you make do not affect other users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selecting a compiler on the left displays information about it on the
      right hand side of the dialog. Here you enter or edit the required
      information on three tabs, as follows.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Compiler Tab
    </h2>
    <p>
      Enter the the full path to the compiler&#39;s executable file. This must
      be the command line version of the compiler - for example Delphi&#39;s
      DCC32.exe. You can either type in the name of the file or choose from a
      standard file dialog by clicking the ellipsis button to the right of the
      edit box. As soon as the cursor leaves the edit box the selected compiler
      is assigned the file name and the compiler name will be emboldened.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Command Line Tab
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> passes certain switches to the command line of each
      supported compiler. You can edit these switches if you wish the compilers
      to perform differently. You can add, deleted or edit switches as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Add a switch</em>. Enter its name in the edit box and click <em>
        Add</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Delete a switch</em>. Select the switch in the list box the click
        the <em>Delete</em> button.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Edit a switch</em>. Select the switch in the list box to copy it to
        the edit box. Change the switch and click <em>Replace</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Restore default switches</em>. Click the <em>Defaults</em> button.
        This can be useful if you have made some changes to switches and <em>
        CodeSnip</em> ceases to function properly.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <span
       class="warning">Warning:</span> You should not remove any switches that
      cause the compilers to generate warnings and error messages since <em>
      CodeSnip</em> will not detect compilation errors correctly without these
      switches. You are strongly recommended not to pass any switches that
      alter the compiler&#39;s output otherwise <em>CodeSnip</em> may fail to
      operate correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an explanation of the purpose of the switches please see your
      compiler&#39;s documentation.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Output Log Tab
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> logs and examines the output of the compiler to
      determine if the compilation was clean or contained warnings. It also
      examines the output for error messages when the compilation fails. A
      summary of the logged output can be displayed by the user when warnings
      or errors occur. Instead of displaying the whole log the program filters
      out the required messages. It does this by looking for some common text
      that preceeds the messages in the log. These prefixes are listed in the
      <em>Log Prefixes</em> editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using an English language version of a compiler the default
      values will be correct. For all Delphis and Free Pascal the default
      values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For fatal errors: &quot;Fatal: &quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        For general errors: &quot;Error: &quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        For warnings: &quot;Warning: &quot;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For languages other than English you need to compile some code that
      generates warnings, errors and fatal errors then check what text preceeds
      each kind of message. This text should be entered in the <em>Log
      Prefixes</em> editor. Failure to do this will mean that CodeSnip
      won&#39;t detect warnings and won&#39;t report errors correctly.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Auto Detecting Compilers
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> can automatically detect the presence of Win 32 Delphi
      compilers from versions 2 to XE4. Click the <em>Auto Detect
      Compilers</em> button to do this. Any supported installed version of
      Delphi will be recorded. This can save considerable time and avoid
      errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Free Pascal cannot be detected automatically and must be configured
      manually.
