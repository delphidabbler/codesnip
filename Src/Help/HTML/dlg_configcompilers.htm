    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is used to let <em>CodeSnip</em> know about the Pascal
      Compilers that are installed on the system. It is displayed using the
      <em>Tools | Configure Compilers</em> menu option. <em>CodeSnip</em> uses
      these compilers when <a href="about_compiler_checks.htm">test
      compiling</a> snippets.
    </p>
    <p class="bordered">
      When using the standard version of CodeSnip each logged on user has their
      own compiler configuration, so any changes you make will not affect other
      users. The portable edition of CodeSnip only supports one set of
      configuration data per installation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supported compilers are listed on the left hand side of the dialogue. If a
      compiler is known to <em>CodeSnip</em> its name appears in bold. Unknown
      compilers (or compilers that are not installed on the local system)
      appear in plain text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selecting a compiler on the left displays information about it on the
      right hand side of the dialogue. Here you enter or edit the required
      information on four or five tabs, as follows.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Compiler Tab
    </h2>
	<h3>
	  Compiler file name
	</h3>
    <p>
      Enter the the full path to the compiler's executable file in the <em>Enter
      compiler executable file name</em> edit box. This must be file name of
      the command line version of the compiler - for example Delphi's DCC32.exe.
      If you prefer you can select the file name from a standard file dialogue
      by clicking the ellipsis button to the right of the edit box. The chosen
      file name is entered in the edit box. As soon as the cursor leaves the
      edit box the file name is checked for validity &ndash; it must exist and
      be an executable file. If it is valid the compiler name will be
      emboldened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pressing the <em>Clear</em> button removes the compiler by deleting the
      path to its executable file. The <em>Enter compiler executable file
      name</em> edit box is cleared.
    </p>
	<h3>
	  Display compiler results
	</h3>
    <p>
      You can choose whether the compiler is included in the table of
      compile results displayed in the <a href="detail_pane.htm">Details
      Pane</a>. This is done using the <em>Display results for this compiler in
      details pane</em> check box. Tick the box to display the compiler's
      results or clear it to hide them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        class="warning"
      >Important Note:</strong> The facility to switch off the display of
      results for selected compilers was designed to limit the number of
      compilers whose results are displayed to avoid cluttering the
      <a href="detail_pane.htm">Details Pane</a> with unnecessary information.
      The feature should not be used to switch off the display of all compilers:
      doing  that will cause a warning message to be displayed in place of the
      compiler results table. To switch off compiler results completely you
      should use  the <a href="dlg_prefs_snippetlayout.htm">Snippet Layout</a>
      page of the <a href="dlg_preferences.htm">Preferences</a> dialogue box to
      remove the <em>Compiler Results Table</em> component from the different
      kinds of snippet pages.
    </p>
	<h3>
	  Automatic compiler detection &amp; registration
	</h3>
	<p>
	  By default <em>CodeSnip </em> will automatically detect and register
	  installed Delphi compilers for use with the program. This can happen in
	  two ways:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
		When the <em>Detect Delphi Compilers</em> button is clicked (see below).
      </li>
	  <li>
	    Optionally, when the program starts up.
	  </li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	  You can prevent a specific Delphi compiler from being automatically
	  registered by clearing the <em>Permit auto-detection & registration of
	  this compiler</em> check box.
	</p>
	<p class="bordered">
	  <strong>Note:</strong> This check box does not appear when the Free Pascal
	  compiler is selected.
	</p>
    <h2>
      Switches Tab
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> passes certain switches to the command line of each
      supported compiler. You can edit these switches if you wish the compilers
      to perform differently. You can add, delete or edit switches as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Add a switch</em>. Enter its name in the edit box and click
        <em>Add</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Delete a switch</em>. Select the switch in the list box the click
        the <em>Delete</em> button.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Edit a switch</em>. Select the switch in the list box to copy it to
        the edit box. Change the switch and click <em>Replace</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Restore default switches</em>. Click the <em>Defaults</em> button.
        This can be useful if you have made some changes to switches and <em>
        CodeSnip</em> ceases to function properly.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For an explanation of the purpose of the switches please see your
      compiler's documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        There is no need to use this tab to provide switches to set the compiler
        search path &ndash; that is very cumbersome. Instead you can use the
        <em>Search Paths</em> tab to define your search paths and to generate
        the correct switches automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        Similarly, when you have selected the Delphi XE2 or later compiler,
        there is no need to set up the <code>-NS</code> switch to specify the
        namespaces to search for various units. The <em>Namespaces</em> tab can
        be used to make this task simpler and to generate the correct
        <code>-NS</code> switch.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong
        class="warning"
      >Warning:</strong> You should not remove any switches that cause the
      compilers to generate warnings and error messages since <em>CodeSnip</em>
      will not detect compilation errors correctly without these switches. You
      are strongly recommended not to pass any switches that alter the
      compiler's output otherwise <em>CodeSnip</em> may fail to operate
      correctly.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Namespaces Tab
    </h2>
    <p class="bordered">
      <strong>Note:</strong> This tab appears only if the selected compiler is
      Delphi XE2 or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delphi XE2 or later qualify units from the RTL and VCL are prefixed with
      the name of the unit's namespace. Much of the code managed by
      <em>CodeSnip</em> uses unqualified unit names for reasons of backward
      compatibility. In order for the unqualified units to be found on Delphi
      XE2 and later the compiler has to be given a list of namespaces to search
      for the units.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tab enables you to configure such a namespace, as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Add a namespace</em>. Enter its name in the edit box and click
        <em>Add</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Delete a namespace</em>. Select the namespaces in the list box the
        click the <em>Delete</em> button.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Edit a namespace</em>. Select the namespace in the list box to copy
        it to the edit box. Change the namespace name and click
        <em>Replace</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Restore default namespaces</em>. Click the <em>Defaults</em> button.
        This can be useful if you have made some changes to namespaces and
        <em>CodeSnip</em> fails to compile snippets correctly. The default
        namespaces have been chosen because they contain the most commonly used
        units. <strong>Note:</strong> New releases of <em>CodeSnip</em> may
        change the default namespaces. Should this happen after you have
        customised the namespaces you will need to use the <em>Defaults</em>
        button to force the program to recognise the new default settings.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For a list of RTL and VCL units, and the namespaces to which they belong,
      see your compiler's documentation.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Search Paths Tab
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you have your own or third party units you want your user-defined
      routines to reference you need to tell the compilers where to find them.
      This tab lets you do just that. Because you often use different versions
      of the same unit for different compilers, you must set up each compiler's
      search path separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Existing Paths</em> list displays any current search paths. You
      edit the search paths as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Add a path</em>. Enter the required directory in the <em>Add or edit
        path</em> edit box then click <em>Add</em>. You can browse for the
        directory using a standard <em>Browse For Folders</em> dialogue box by
        clicking the ellipsis button to the right of the edit control.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Edit an existing path</em>. Select the directory in the list box.
        This copies the directory name to the edit control. Modify the name then
        click <em>Replace</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Delete a path</em>. Select the directory in the list box and press
        <em>Delete</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Change the order of the search paths</em>. Select a directory in the
        list box then move it up and down the list using the buttons that
        display the up and down arrows. <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+Up</span>
        and <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+Down</span> have the same effect.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Output Log Tab
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> logs and examines the output of the compiler to
      determine if the compilation was clean or contained warnings. It also
      examines the output for error messages when the compilation fails. A
      summary of the logged output can be displayed by the user when warnings
      or errors occur. Instead of displaying the whole log the program filters
      out the required messages. It does this by looking for some common text
      that precedes the messages in the log. These prefixes are listed in the
      <em>Log Prefixes</em> editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using an English language version of a compiler the default
      values will be correct. For all Delphis and Free Pascal the default
      values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For fatal errors: &quot;Fatal: &quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        For general errors: &quot;Error: &quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        For warnings: &quot;Warning: &quot;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For languages other than English you need to compile some code that
      generates warnings, errors and fatal errors then check what text precedes
      each kind of message. This text should be entered in the <em>Log
      Prefixes</em> editor. Failure to do this will mean that CodeSnip
      won't detect warnings and won't report errors correctly.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Auto Detecting Compilers
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> can automatically detect the presence of Win 32 Delphi
      compilers from Delphi 2 to Delphi 11.x Alexandria. Click the <em>Detect
      Delphi Compilers</em> button to do this. Any supported installed version
      of Delphi will be recorded<sup>&dagger;</sup>. This can save considerable
	  time and avoid errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Free Pascal cannot be detected automatically and must be configured
      manually.
    </p>
	<p>
	  If the <em>Automatically register newly installed Delphi compilers at
	  program startup</em> check box is ticked then, when it starts up,
	  <em>CodeSnip</em> will attempt to register any known Delphi compiler that
	  is not yet registered with Delphi<sup>&dagger;</sup>.
	</p>
	<p class="bordered">
	  &dagger; Any version of Delphi for which the <em>Permit auto-detection
	  &amp; registration of this compiler</em> check box is cleared will not be
	  recorded.
