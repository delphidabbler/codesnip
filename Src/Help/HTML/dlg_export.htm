    <h1>
      <a name="dlg_export"></a>Export Snippets Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box is used to export selected user defined snippets to a
      file. Exported files can be sent to other <em>CodeSnip</em> users who can
      import the snippets into their own user database.
    </p>
    <p>  
      The dialog is accessed from the <em>Database | Export Snippets</em> menu
      item. The menu item is only available if there are user defined snippets
      in the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      You specify the snippets to be exported by checking the required snippets
      in the <em>Select snippets to be exported</em> check list box. Only user
      defined snippets are listed and any user defined snippet that is selected
      in the main display when the dialog box is displayed is pre-selected.
      Checking or unchecking a category selects or deselects all the snippets in
      that category. At least one snippet must be selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next you specify the name of the export file by entering it in the
      <em>Save to file</em> edit control. You can select the required file by
      clicking the ellipsis button to the right of the edit box to display the
      <a href="dlg_exportfile.htm">Export File</a> dialog box. The selected file
      name is entered in the edit control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the <em>OK</em> button to export the snippets. If no snippet is
      selected or no file name is specified then an error message is displayed
      and the dialog box is not closed. The export can be aborted by clicking
      the <em>Cancel</em> button.
    </p>
