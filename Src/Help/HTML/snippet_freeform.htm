    </h1>
    <p>
      Unlike the other <a href="snippet_kinds.htm">snippet kinds</a>,
      <em>freeform</em> code snippets can contain any kind of source code. The
      code does not need to compilable, and nor does its layout need to conform
      to any rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the nature of freeform snippets, <em>CodeSnip</em> can make no
      assumptions about them, and therefore cannot include the code in a
      compilable unit. This has two major implications:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Freeform snippets are never included in generated units.
      </li>
      <li>
        The snippets cannot be test-compiled (because <em>CodeSnip</em> cannot
        generate a test unit.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If you can live without these features and just want to use
      <em>CodeSnip</em> as a simple code repository, freeform snippets are by
      far the easiest way to create your own snippets as there are no rules
      to conform to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> You will never find freeform code in the online
      database.
    </p>
    <h2>
      When should freeform be used?
    </h2>
    <p>
      You should use freeform snippets if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You don't need <em>CodeSnip</em>'s unit generation or test compilation
        features for the code.
      </li>
      <li>
        You don't want the hassle of working out the code's dependencies on
        other units and routines, although you can if you wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        The code doesn't conform with one of <em>CodeSnip</em>'s other snippet
        kinds, for example if the code is a class or a complete unit.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      How do I check if code is freeform?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Select the snippet in the <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a>
      and look in the <a href="detail_pane.htm">Detail Pane</a>. Look for the
      &quot;Kind&quot; section below the source code.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How do I change the snippet to another kind?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Select the snippet in the <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a>
      then select the <em>Snippets | Edit Snippet</em> menu item to open the
      <a href="dlg_editsnippet.htm">Edit Snippet</a> dialogue box. On the
      <em>Code</em> tab select a value in the <em>Kind</em> drop down list and
      press OK.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="warning">Warning:</strong> Don't change the kind unless you
      are happy that the snippet conforms to the requirements of the new kind.
