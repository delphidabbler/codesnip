      The Main Display
    </h1>
    <p>
      CodeSnip's main window is divided into four parts:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <div>
          <strong><a
            href="main_menu.htm"
          >Menu menu</a></strong>
        </div>
        <div>
          The main menu appears at the top of the window.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <strong>Tool bar</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
          The tool bar sits just below the main menu. It has tool buttons that
          provide short cuts to a subset of menu commands.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <strong><a
            href="overview_pane.htm"
          >Overview pane</a></strong>
        </div>
        <div>
          The Overview pane is on the left of the window. It is used to list all
          the snippets in the database. Snippets are organised by category,
          alphabetically or by <a
            href="snippet_kinds.htm"
          >snippet kind</a>.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <strong><a
            href="detail_pane.htm"
          >Detail pane</a></strong>
        </div>
        <div>
          This pane is on the right hand side of the window. It displays
          detailed information about selected snippets and other items of
          information. Information is displayed in one or more tabs.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <strong>Status bar</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
          The status bar lies across the bottom of the window. It displays
          information about the database and any actives searches. When a main
          or context menu item is highlighted brief help text describing the
          menu item is also displayed here.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The relative sizes of the Overview and Detail panes can be changed by
      dragging the vertical splitter bar that separates the two panes.
    </p>
