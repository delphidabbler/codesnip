    </h1>
    <p>
      Use this dialogue box to find snippets containing specified text. The
      dialogue is displayed from the <em>Search | Find Text</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter the text you want to search for in the <em>Text to find</em> combo
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      When more than one search word is entered you have a choice of whether to
      search for snippets containing all the words, or any of them. You specify
      which of these options you want by choosing the relevant radio button in
      the <em>Search logic</em> group box. For example, choosing the <em>Find
      all words</em> option and searching for &quot;Foo Bar&quot; would match
      the text &quot;Foo and Bar&quot; but would not match &quot;Foo&quot; or
      &quot;Bar&quot;. Choosing <em>Find and word</em> instead and again
      searching for &quot;Foo Bar&quot; would match all the previous examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two more options for further refining the search:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Use the <em>Whole words only</em> check box to ensure that the search
        only looks up words that exactly match those specified. If the check box
        is cleared then words containing the specified text will also be found.
        For example when the check box is ticked search for &quot;Foo&quot; will
        not match &quot;FooBar&quot;, but when the check box is cleared, the two
        words will match.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the search case sensitive by checking the <em>Case sensitive</em>
        check box. In this case searching for &quot;Foo&quot; would only match
        the exact text and would not match &quot;foo&quot or &quot;FOO&quot;.
        If the check box is cleared then case is ignored. Now searching for
        &quot;Foo;&quot; will match both &quot;foo&quot and &quot;FOO&quot;.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You have the option of finding text across the whole database or, if you
      have run another search, searching only the snippets selected by the
      previous search, and so refining that search. The <em>Search scope</em>
      group box is used to decide which course of action to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose to search the whole database any previous search is
      abandoned before this search is run. This means that if no snippets are
      found matching your search criteria, the previous search is lost and the
      whole database will be selected. On the other hand if you choose to refine
      a search and this search fails to find any snippets, the earlier search
      remains unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Search scope</em> group box is disabled if there was no existing
      search when this dialogue box was opened, and the search operates on the
      entire database.
