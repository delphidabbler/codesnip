    <p>
      A <em>unit</em> snippet defines a complete Pascal unit. If a unit compiles
      successfully in Delphi or in Free Pascal then it is valid for use as a
      <em>unit</em> snippet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Unit</em> snippets are compilable just like all the other
      <a href="snippet_kinds.htm">snippet kinds</a>, except
      <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">freeform</a>. However, that is where the
      similarities end. Specifically, <em>unit</em> snippets:
    </p>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        Can't be referenced by other snippets except as cross references.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can't depend on any other snippets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can't be included in a generated unit. This is obvious: units can't
        contain other units.
      </li>
      <li>
        Must be self contained. Any constants, types (including classes and
        advanced records) or routines referenced by the unit's code must be
        defined in the unit itself on in a unit included in one the unit's
        <strong>uses</strong>
        statements<sup style="font-size:smaller;">&dagger;</sup>. To compile
        correctly the used units must be accessible to the available compilers
        (i.e. be on the compiler's search
        path<sup style="font-size:smaller;">&Dagger;</sup>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not have comments that contain the snippet description inserted into
        the source code when copied or printed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Here is an example of a <em>unit</em> snippet:
    </p>
<pre class="source-code">// A sample unit, adapted from the CodeSnip source code repository

unit UShowCaseCtrl;

interface

uses
  Controls;

type
  // Simple transparent control designed to be placed over other controls to
  // prevent user interaction with the "show cased" controls.
  TShowCaseCtrl = class(TCustomControl)
  protected
    // Modifies window creation parameters. Ensures control is transparent.
    procedure CreateParams(var Params: TCreateParams); override;
  end;

implementation

uses
  Windows;

{ TShowCaseCtrl }

procedure TShowCaseCtrl.CreateParams(var Params: TCreateParams);
begin
  inherited;
  Params.ExStyle := Params.ExStyle or WS_EX_TRANSPARENT;
end;

end.</pre>
    <p>
      In this unit, the <var>Windows</var> and <var>Controls</var> units must be
      accessible to the available compilers. All is well in this case because
      the units are in the VCL.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      &dagger; For other compilable snippet types the required units are entered
      in the <a href="dlg_editsnippet.htm">Snippets Editor</a>, but for
      <em>unit</em> snippets they are entered in the source code itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &Dagger; Compiler search paths can be configured in the <em>Search
      Paths</em> tab of the <a href="dlg_configcompilers.htm">Configure
      Compilers</a> dialogue box.
