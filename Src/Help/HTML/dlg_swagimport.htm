      SWAG Import Wizard
    </h1>
    <p>
      This wizard is used to enable you to import <em>packets</em> from the
      <a href="about_swag.htm">SWAG Database</a> into your code snippets
      database. (A SWAG <em>packet</em> is roughly the equivalent of a
			<em>CodeSnip</em> snippet: packets are converted into snippets before
			being imported.)
		</p>
	  <p>
			The wizard is accessed from the <em>Snippets | Import
      Snippets From SWAG</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Page 1: <em>Import packets from SWAG as new snippets</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page gives an overview of how to use the wizard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wizard requires that you have a suitable copy of SWAG stored on your
      computer. If you haven't yet got it then you need to download it before
      continuing. The instructions shown in the box on this page of the wizard
      explain how to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are ready, click the <em>Next</em> button.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Page 2: <em>Select SWAG database download folder</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      On this page you need to provide the full path to the SWAG database on
			your system. By default the required folder is the <code>swag</code>
			sub-directory of the folder where you extracted the SWAG zip file.
		</p>
		<p>
			Enter the path in the edit box. You can click the ellipsis button to the
			right of the edit box to display a standard browse for folder dialogue box
			and choose the folder from there. The chosen folder will be entered into
			the edit box for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have entered the path click <em>Next</em>. The data in the folder
      will then be read and, if valid, the next page of the wizard will be
      displayed. A progress bar may be displayed if the process of reading the
      data takes some time. If the data is invalid an error message will be
      displayed and the page will not change.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Page 3: <em>Select required packets</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      When this page is first displayed it displays all the categories of
      packets available in the SWAG database in the <em>SWAG categories</em>
      list box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose a category in the list and click the <em>Show Packets In
      Category</em> button to display a list of its packets in the right
      hand list box. Alternatively just double-click the category name. The
      first time you choose a category the wizard will read the list of packets
      from the database and a progress bar may be displayed while this is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select any packets you want to import by ticking the check box next to
      the packet's name. If you want to preview the packet before deciding
      whether to import it, highlight it and click the <em>Preview Selected
			Packet</em> button. Alternatively just double click the packet name. The
			packet will then be read from the database (if necessary) and displayed
			in a dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeat this process for further categories if you wish. When you are
      ready to import your chosen packets click the <em>Next</em> button to
      display the next page. Note that you must select at least one packet in
      order to move on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="warning">Warning:</strong> Do not select too many packets
      to be imported at one time because the import process is not very
      efficient and can take a long time.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Page 4: <em>Ready to import</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page lists all the packets you have selected for import along with
      the unique ID (i.e. snippet name) that will be assigned to the
			<em>CodeSnip</em> snippet after import. Note that some packets may need to
			be retrieved from the SWAG database when the page is displayed and a
			progress bar may be displayed while this happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should review your selection. If you want to make any changes use the
      <em>Back</em> button to go back to the previous page and de-select any
      unwanted packets or select any you may have missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are ready to proceed, click the <em>Import</em> button. Once
      <em>Import</em> has been clicked the wizard will perform the import
      &ndash; there is no going back. A dialogue box will be displayed while the
      import proceeds. When the import has finished the final page of the wizard
      will be displayed.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Page 5: <em>Import complete</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page simply confirms the import has completed. All the selected
			packets will have been converted to snippets and imported into the same
			special category, the name of which will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the <em>Finish</em> button to close the wizard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imported snippets are fully editable like any other user defined
      snippet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="warning">Warning:</strong> <em>CodeSnip</em> does not track
			packets imported from SWAG, so if you import the same packet more than
			once a duplicate snippet will be created for it in your local database
			&ndash; the original will not be overwritten. You will not be warned about
			such duplications.
