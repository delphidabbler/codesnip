    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is displayed when the <em>File | Save Unit</em> menu
      option is clicked. It is used to specify the file name, file type and
      formatting information for the source code unit that is to be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      All currently selected snippets, with the exception of any
      <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">freeform</a> snippets, are included in the
      generated unit. (See the <a href="task_search.htm">Search Database</a>
      task for information on how to select the required snippets).
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue is a standard Windows save dialogue box with a few added
      options.
    </p>
    <p>
      You specify the name and folder for the file where the unit will be saved
      in in the usual way. Note that the chosen file name, minus its extension
      must be a valid Pascal unit name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the <em>Save as type</em> drop down list to specify the type of file
      to be saved. Options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A Pascal unit file (.pas) - The code is written to a file with
        extension .pas. The unit is given a name based on the file name.
      </li>
      <li>
        A plain text file (.txt) - This is the same as the Pascal unit file
        except that the extension is .txt rather than .pas.
      </li>
      <li>
        An HTML file (.html) - This option writes the source code out as a
        valid XHTML document that uses CSS to format the code. The document can
        contain syntax highlighting if the <em>Use syntax highlighting</em>
        check box is checked.
      </li>
      <li>
        A rich text file (.rtf) - The source code is written out as an RTF
        document. Again syntax highlighting can be used if the <em>Use syntax
        highlighting</em> check box is checked.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each snippet's description can be written as a Pascal comment to the
      output file. Use the <em>Comment style</em> drop down list to specify the
      style of commenting to be used. Comments can be inhibited using by
      selecting the <em>No comments</em> option from the list. If the
      <em>Truncate comments to 1st paragraph</em> check box is ticked then only
      the first paragraph of the snippet's description is used. Clearing this
      check box means that all of the description is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output can be previewed by clicking the <em>Preview</em> button. This
      displays the source code in a dialogue box, formatted according to your
      selections. Text in the preview can be selected and copied to the
      clipboard if required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the <em>Save</em> button to write the source code to disk or <em>
      Cancel</em> to abort.
    </p>
