    </h1>
    <p>
      Use this dialogue box to find snippets that are referenced by the
      currently selected snippet and / or those snippets reference that snippet.
      The dialogue is displayed from the <em>Search | Find Cross Refs</em> menu
      option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The search can be customised by checking or clearing the following check
      boxes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Search for required snippets</em>. Selecting this option causes
        all snippets that are needed to compile the selected snippet to be
        included in the search result. If the related <em>Search
        recursively</em> box is checked the search continues through the found
        snippets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Search for snippets that depend on this one</em>. Choose this option
        to include in the search results all snippets that depend upon (i.e.
        require) this one.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Search for &quot;see also&quot; cross references</em>. This option
        includes snippets referenced as &quot;see also&quot; to be included in
        the search result. These snippets are not necessarily needed to compile
        the selected snippet, but are related to it conceptually. Again,
        checking the related <em>Search recursively</em> check box causes the
        search to recurse through the found &quot;see also&quot; cross
        references.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Search for snippets that cross-reference this one</em>. Choose this
        option to include in the search results all snippets that
        cross-reference this one.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Include &quot;xxxx&quot; in search</em> (where xxxx is the name of
        the selected snippet). Checking this box simply includes the selected
        snippet in the search results.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You must check at least one of the <em>Search for required snippets</em>
      or <em>Search for &quot;see also&quot; cross references</em> options.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> Any cross references selected using this dialogue
      box will replace any search results that were previously displayed. A
      message to this effect will be displayed in the dialogue box if it is
      displayed when search results are being displayed.
