      Find Cross References Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      Use this dialog to find snippets that are referenced by the currently
      selected snippet. The dialog box is displayed from the <em>Search | Find
      Cross Refs</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The search can be customised by checking or clearing the following check 
      boxes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Search for required snippets</em>. Selecting this option causes
        all snippets that are needed to compile the selected snippet to be
        included in the search result. If the related <em>Search
        recursively</em> box is checked the search continues through the found
        snippets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Search for &quot;see also&quot; cross references</em>. This option
        includes snippets referenced as &quot;see also&quot; to be included in
        the search result. These snippets are not necessarily needed to compile
        the selected snippet, but are related to it conceptually. Again,
        checking the related <em>Search recursively</em> check box causes the
        search to recurse through the found &quot;see also&quot; cross
        references.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Include &quot;xxxx&quot; in search</em> (where xxxx is the name of
        the selected snippet). Checking this box simply includes the selected
        snippet in the search results.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that you must check at least one of the <em>Search for required
      snippets</em> or <em>Search for &quot;see also&quot; cross references</em>
      options.
    </p>
