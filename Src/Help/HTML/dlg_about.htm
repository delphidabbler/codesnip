      <a name="dlg_about"></a>About Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box provides various pieces of information about
      <em>CodeSnip</em> and the <em>Code Snippets Database</em>. It is accessed
      from the <em>Help | About</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program's version number is displayed in the heading of the dialogue
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <em>CodeSnip</em> is unregistered then a <em>Register CodeSnip</em>
      button will be displayed at the bottom left of the dialogue box. Clicking
      this button displays the <a href="dlg_register.htm">Registration
      Wizard</a> that can be used to register the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition the dialogue has three tabs, each of which is described below.
    </p>
    <h2>
      About The Program
    </h2>
    <p>
      This tab shows:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        The program's copyright and licensing information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Credits and Attributions.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the program has been registered.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      About The Database
    </h2>
    <p>
      This tab shows:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        Where to find the <em>Code Snippets Database</em> online.
      </li>
      <li>
        Licensing information.
      </li>
      <li>
        A list of contributors to the database along with a list of testers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Paths &amp; Files
    </h2>
    <p>
      This tab gives information about various directories used by
      <em>CodeSnip</em> and enables the program's config files to be viewed.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Directories
    </h3>
    <p>
      The directories for which information is available are:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        <em>Install Directory</em> &ndash; the directory where <em>CodeSnip</em>
        is installed or, more accurately, the directory from which the current
        instance of the program was executed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Main Database Directory</em> &ndash; the directory containing a
        local copy of the DelphiDabbler Code Snippets Database database. This
        directory may be empty if the user has not downloaded the database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>User Database Directory</em> &ndash; the directory containing the
        current user's database. This directory may be empty if the user has not
        created any user defined snippets.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The full path of any directory may be shortened if there is not enough
      room to display it all. In this case a pop-up window will display the path
      in full if the mouse cursor is hovered over the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking the button to the right of each directory will open that
      directory in Windows Explorer. If the directory does not exist then the
      button will be disabled.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Config Files
    </h3>
    <p>
      The content of the program's application wide and per-user config files
      can be displayed by clicking the <em>View Application Config File</em> and
      <em>View Per-User Config File</em> buttons respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find documentation of the meaning of the config file entries in
      <em>CodeSnip<em>'s <a
