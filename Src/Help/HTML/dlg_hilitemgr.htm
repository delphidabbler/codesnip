    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is displayed from the <em>User Defined Styles</em>
      option of the drop-down menu displayed by the <em>Use Named Style</em>
      button located on the <a href="dlg_prefs_hiliter.htm">Syntax
      Highlighter</a> tab of the <a href="dlg_preferences.htm">Preferences</a>
      dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue box is used to manage and display saved user-defined syntax
      highlighter styles. The available styles are listed in the <em>Available
      highlighter styles</em> list box.
    </p>
    <p>
      To display a style either select the required style and press the <em>Use
      &amp; Close</em> button or, alternatively, double click the style in the
      list box. The dialogue box will be closed immediately and the style will
      be displayed in the main dialogue box ready for editing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also delete unwanted styles from the dialogue box by selecting the
      required style name and then clicking the <em>Delete</em> button. You will
      be asked to confirm this action. <strong>Note:</strong> the deleted style
      will be restored if you cancel the
      <a href="dlg_preferences.htm">Preferences</a> dialogue box instead of
      OKing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue box can be closed without selecting one of the listed styles
      by clicking the <em>Done</em> button.
