    </h1>
    <p>
      Use this dialogue box to manually select the snippets that are displayed.
      The dialogue is displayed from the <em>Search | Select Snippets</em> menu
      option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snippets are displayed sorted under categories. When the dialogue box
      opens only the categories are shown. They can be expanded and collapsed
      in the usual way: by clicking the arrow symbols (or plus/minus symbols)
      that appear to the left of the categories; by double clicking the
      category; by using the <span class="smallcaps">Left</span>,
      <span class="smallcaps">Right</span> and
      <span class="smallcaps">Enter</span> keys. Alternatively use the
      <em>Expand All</em> and <em>Collapse All</em> buttons on the right of
      the dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snippets are selected simply by placing a check mark next to the name of
      the required snippets. Checking or unchecking a category will select or
      de-select all the snippets in the category. When the dialogue box appears
      all snippets currently displayed by the program are selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also four buttons that can be used to select or deselect groups
      of snippets. The options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Select All</em> selects all the snippets in the database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Clear All</em> deselects all the snippets in the database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>User Defined</em> selects all the user defined snippets in the
        database. The button will be disabled if there are no user defined
        snippets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Main</em> selects all the snippets in the main database.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When the selection has been made, click the <em>OK</em> to accept the
      changes. At least one snippet must be selected. Click <em>Cancel</em> to
      abort your selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> Any selection made using this dialogue box will
      replace any search results that were previously displayed. A message to
      this effect will be displayed in the dialogue box if it is displayed when
      search results are being displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of the this dialogue box is to enable you to specify
      precisely which snippets will be included in a generated unit. See the
      <a href="task_generateunit.htm">Generate Unit</a> task for information
      about this subject.
