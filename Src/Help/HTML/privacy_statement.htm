      <a id="privacy_statement" name="privacy_statement"></a>Privacy Statement
      for DelphiDabbler Codesnip
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Offline Privacy
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> stores some personal information in two configuration
      files:
    </p>
    <h3>
      <code>Common.ini</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <code>Common.ini</code> is located in the in the
      <code>%ProgramData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip</code> folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data that is stored in <code>Common.ini</code> is:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        A unique 32 digit hexadecimal key based on attributes of your computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        A 32 digit hexadecimal registration key (registered programs only).
      </li>
      <li>
        The registered user name or nickname (registered programs only).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The data that is used to create the hexidecimal keys cannot be recovered
      from the keys.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <code>User.3.ini</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <code>User.3.ini</code> is found in the current user's
      <code>%AppData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip</code> folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The file stores several user-specific application data
      settings such as your preferences. The only personal information is as
      follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any user name or email address you provided if you ever entered the
        information in a dialog box. This is used simply to automatically enter
        the data in dialog boxes where needed, to save you re-typing it. See
        below for details of activities that require either or both a name or
        email address to be submitted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your user name and password if you configured <em>CodeSnip</em> to
        access the internet using a proxy server. The information is used only
        to access the proxy. Passwords and encrypted.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you have upgraded from CodeSnip v2 there may also be a file named
      <code>User.ini</code>. This contains pretty much the same information as
      <code>User.3.ini</code>. The file is ignored by <em>CodeSnip</em> v3.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Spyware
    </h2>
    <p>
      No spyware or other software that threatens your privacy has been
      deliberately or knowingly included with <em>CodeSnip</em>. If the program
      is found to contain spyware it will have been added by third parties and
      the author asks to be informed of any such occurrence. Please report any
      suspicious behaviour via <a
        href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/contact"
        class="weblink"
        target="_blank"
      >www.delphidabbler.com/contact</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> never tries to &quot;phone home&quot; of its own
      accord. It only goes online in response to user requests. Should you
      notice any unauthorised activity please inform the author since it is
      likely that your copy of the program has been hacked by some third party.
    </p>
    <h2>
      CodeSnip Online Activity
    </h2>
    <p>
      Various user-initiated actions cause <em>CodeSnip</em> to go online. They
      are:
    </p>
    <ol class="unspaced">
      <li>
        Updating the database.
      </li>
      <li>
        Registering the program.
      </li>
      <li>
        Submitting code for inclusion in the main database.
      </li>
      <li>
        Displaying the latest news in the &quot;CodeSnip News&quot; dialog box.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accessing various websites via hyperlinks and menu options.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accessing the internet using a proxy server.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The first four actions are performed directly by <em>CodeSnip</em>,
      which communicates with web services located at www.delphidabbler.com
      using HTTP on port 80. The fifth action simply displays web pages in a
      browser. The sixth passes user information to the proxy server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal data will neither be published on the DelphiDabbler website nor
      knowingly passed to third parties. Furthermore your data will only be
      used by the author for the purposes described below.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Updating the Database
    </h3>
    <p>
      This activity is started by displaying the &quot;Update From Web&quot;
      dialog box and clicking its &quot;Update from Web&quot; button. <em>
      CodeSnip</em> then contacts the update web service and sends the
      following information:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        Unique program key (see above for details).
      </li>
      <li>
        Program version number.
      </li>
      <li>
        Operating system description.
      </li>
      <li>
        Internet Explorer version.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is recorded in two places:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Each transaction is recorded in a log file on the web server. This log
        is used for tracking any database errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          A database of the program keys is updated with the following data:
        </div>
        <ul class="unspaced">
          <li>
            the number of times that program has updated the database;
          </li>
          <li>
            the first and latest version of CodeSnip having that program key;
          </li>
          <li>
            the date of the first and latest updates;
          </li>
          <li>
            the current operating system being used;
          </li>
          <li>
            the current Internet Explorer version being used.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          This database is used to provide CodeSnip usage information and to
          track the operating systems and browser control versions currently in
          use. This information informs development of CodeSnip.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This information may be used to update the registered program database.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of these records store any information that can be tracked back to an
      individual.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Registering the Program
    </h3>
    <p>
      This activity is started when the user chooses to register <em>
      CodeSnip</em>. A wizard appears that guides the user through the
      registration process. The wizard displays the data that is to be sent to
      the registration web service. The data is only sent if the user clicks
      the wizard&#39;s &quot;Submit&quot; button. The data is:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        The program&#39;s id, name and version information.
      </li>
      <li>
        The unique program key (see above for details).
      </li>
      <li>
        The user name or nickname.
      </li>
      <li>
        A description of the operating system and version of Internet Explorer
        being used.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The registration data is recorded in a database on the DelphiDabbler web
      server. The data is only used to keep track of the number of people using
      the different versions of the program and what operating systems are being
      used. The registration web service returns a registration code to the
      program. <em>CodeSnip</em> records this code, with the user name, in
      <code>Common.ini</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The registration information may be updated when the user updates the
      database (see &quot;Updating the Database&quot; above).
    </p>
    <h3>
      Submitting code to the main database
    </h3>
    <p>
      This activity is started from the <em>Database | Submit Snippets</em> menu
      option and data is collected using the resulting wizard. Clicking the
      <em>Submit</em> button in the wizard sends the following information to
      the <em>DelphiDabbler</em> code submission web service:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        The <em>CodeSnip</em> program version number.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your name, email address any comments entered in the wizard.
      </li>
      <li>
        All the routines you selected to send.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can preview the data to be sent (in XML format) from the wizard. The
      XML will be stored in a file on the <em>DelphiDabbler</em> server until
      processed. The data is also emailed to the database maintainer (currently
      the author of <em>CodeSnip</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The routines may be edited and published on the Code Snippets online
      database and distributed to <em>CodeSnip</em> users. Your name may be used
      to credit the routines. Your email address will not be published and is
      used only to contact you with any queries about the submitted code.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Displaying the latest news
    </h3>
    <p>
      This action is performed by selecting the <em>Help | CodeSnip News</em>
      menu option or by clicking the &quot;Latest News&quot; button in the
      &quot;Update from Web&quot; dialog box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> simply requests an XML document containing an RSS 2.0
      news feed from the DelphiDabbler website using HTTP on port 80. No
      personal information is included in the request.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Accessing Websites via Links and Menu Options
    </h3>
    <p>
      CodeSnip's <em>Help | On The Web</em> menu option leads to sub menu
      items that cause various pages from DelphiDabbler.com to be displayed in
      the user's default browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, various links in the program's main display, some dialog
      boxes and the help file access remote websites which are displayed in your
      default browser. You should refer to the relevant website's privacy
      policies to learn how they use any data you supply when visiting their
      pages. <strong>DelphiDabbler has no control over the content of linked
      third party websites and you follow such links at your own risk.</strong>
    </p>
    <h3>
      Accessing the internet using a proxy server
    </h3>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> can be configured to use a proxy server to access the
      internet. In this case the program sends the appropriate user name and
      password to the proxy server if required. <strong>DelphiDabbler has no
      control over the proxy server and you should satisfy yourself that the
      proxy you use is trustworthy. You use this feature at your own
      risk.</strong>
