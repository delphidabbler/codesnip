# Changelog

This is the change log for _DelphiDabbler CodeSnip_. It begins with the first ever pre-release version of _CodeSnip_.

Releases are listed in reverse version number order.

> Note that _CodeSnip_ v4 was developed in parallel with v3 for a while. As a consequence some v3 releases have later release dates than early v4 releases.

## Release v4.16.0 of 31 May 2020

This is a significant update. It's purpose is to remove CodeSnip's dependencies on the delphidabbler.com website and associated web services. This was done because of the expected June 2020 closure or reduced functionality of delphidabbler.com. Some affected features were removed and others replaced with alternatives.

* Removed all dependencies on web services. The following changes were made as a consequence of this:
  * Replaced the option to update the main DelphiDabbler Code Snippets database from the web with an option to update it from locally stored data:
    * Replaced the _Update from Web_ dialogue box with a new wizard. Menu options on the _Snippets_ menu were renamed accordingly and the old tool bar button was removed.
    * Changed the database update code to use data that has been manually downloaded from the `delphidabbler/code-snippets` GitHub project.
    * Modified the database reading code to accept both the new Code Snippets database v2 format _and_ the legacy v1 format.
  * Replaced the option to import SWAG snippets from an on-line REST service with an option to import snippets from locally stored data.
    * Revised the SWAG import wizard re the changes to the import method.
    * Modified the SWAG import code to use data that has been manually downloaded from the `delphidabbler/swag` GitHub project.
  * The option to register the program was removed. No registration key is now generated or stored.
  * Replaced the option to read and display the CodeSnip RSS news feed with one to display the CodeSnip Blog.
  * Removed the menu option used to check for program updates.
  * Removed the background task that automatically checked for program and database updates.
  * Removed the option to submit snippets for addition to the DelphiDabbler Code Snippets database.
  * Removed support for a proxy web server - now unnecessary.
  * Removed support for the `--test-server` command line option that enabled use of a different server to test web services.
  * Updated install program so it no longer displays a page stating that CodeSnip will go automatically go on-line to check for updates.
* Removed references and links to delphidabbler.com from the program, the installer, the help file and documentation. Some references were deleted while others were replaced with alternatives, including:
  * Changed the URL of the FAQs to refer to the `codesnip-faq` GitHub project.
  * References to swag.delphidabbler.com were replaced with references to the `delphidabbler/swag` project on GitHub.
  * URLs that were redirected via a service on delphidabbler.com were replaced by hard coded URLs.
* The export file format was changed to exclude personal user information. The original format can still be read but any user information is ignored and discarded.
* Config file processing changes:
  * Removed support for reading or writing data relating to removed features.
  * When CodeSnip is first run after updating from an earlier version, any pre-existing config files are purged of any information that is no longer relevant.
  * The common config file is no longer used by the portable edition. Any pre-existing file is deleted the first time the portable edition is run.
  * The common and per-user config file versions were bumped to 7 and 16 respectively.
* Welcome page changes:
  * Removed the _Update Checks_ and _Donate_ sections and related links.
  * Removed links used to check for program and database updates.
  * Replaced the link used to display the news feed with one that displays the CodeSnip blog.

* The operating system detection code was updated to correctly detect all Windows and Windows Server releases as of March 2020.
* Revised the _About_ dialogue box:
  * To display version and licensing information extracted from Code Snippets Database v2 meta data.
  * To remove credits for 3rd party code that is no longer used.
* The bug tracker dialogue boxes were updated re the change of issue tracker from SourceForge to GitHub.
* Removed redundant pages and controls from the _Preferences_ dialogue box.

The new tab appears only for Delphi XE2 and later and obviates the need to manually create -NS commands for passing to the compilers. Suitable default namespaces are provided if none have been configured.
* Implemented [SourceForge] feature request #70: "Let user specify location of user database". This feature is accessed from the new "Move Use Database" option on the Database menu. NOTE: The feature is not available in the portable edition which is designed to keep the user database together with the program.
