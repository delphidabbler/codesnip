    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box is displayed when <em>CodeSnip</em> encounters an
      unexpected error. It invites you to report the error using the
      <em>CodeSnip</em> online bug tracker which, at the time of writing, is
      located on <em>SourceForge.net</em>..
    </p>
    <p>
      The bug tracker is accessed by clicking the <em>Go to the Bug Tracker</em>
      link or by pressing <span class="smallcaps">Alt+B</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Using the Bug Tracker
    </h2>
    <p>
      The bug tracker displays a list of all reported bugs. You should first
      check the list to see if the bug has already been reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the bug has been reported check to see if has been fixed in a later
      version of <em>CodeSnip</em>, and if so, update your copy of the program.
      If the bug is still unfixed and you can provide additional information
      please leave a comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the bug has not been reported, please create a new bug report and
      provide as much information as you can. You should give steps to reproduce
      the bug if possible. You can also upload a screenshot or other file that
      helps to explain the bug.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>CodeSnip</em> will have copied some information
      about the error onto the clipboard. Please paste this information into the
      edit box where you described the error.</strong>
