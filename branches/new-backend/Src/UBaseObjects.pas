{
 * UBaseObjects.pas
 *
 * Contains various common classes for use as base classes to other classes.
 * Classes are:
 *
 *   1) TNoConstructObject:
 *      Object that fails if its constructor is called. Provided as a base class
 *      for classes that contains only class methods and should never be
 *      constructed.
 *   2) TNoPublicConstructObject:
 *      Object that provides a protected constructor but fails if the public
 *      constructor is called. For use as a base class for objects that are
 *      constructed via class methods but should not be constructed directly.
 *   3) TNoPublicConstructIntfObject:
 *      Same as 2) except class descends from TInterfacedObject instead of
 *      TObject.
 *   4) TNonRefCountedObject:
 *      Implements a non reference counted implementation of IInterface.
 *   5) TAggregatedOrLoneObject:
 *      Base class for objects that can either exist as aggregated objects or as
 *      stand-alone reference counted objects. This implementation is based on
 *      code suggested by Hallvard VossBotn, as presented in Eric Harmon's book
 *      "Delphi COM programming".
 *   6) TConditionalFreeObject:
 *      An abstract base class for objects that cannot be destroyed unless some
 *      condition is met.
 *   7) TOwnedConditionalFreeObject:
 *      Class that cannot be destroyed for as long as it has an owner object.
 *      Attempts to free succeed only if Owner property is nil.
 *   8) TDelegatedConditionalFreeObject:
 *      Concrete descendant of TConditionalFreeObject that delegates the
 *      decision about whether the object can be freed to a callback method
 *      passed to the constructor.
 *   9) TControlledConditionalFreeObject:
 *      Concrete descendant of TConditionalFreeObject that defers decision about
 *      whether the object can be freed to an associated controller object.
 *
 * Interfaces:
 *   1) INoPublicConstruct:
 *      A "do nothing" interface that can be supported by objects that don't
 *      allow public construction but cannot inherit from
 *      TNoPublicConstructObject, for example forms.
 *   2) IConditionalFreeController:
 *      Interface supported by objects that control whether an object can be
 *      freed. Used with TControlledConditionalFreeObject.

  INoPublicConstruct:
    Interface that can be supported by objects that do not permit public
    construction but that cannot descend from TNoPublicConstructObject. Such
    objects must handle their own detection of attempts to call public
    constructor. An example of use is in forms that may not be publically
    constructed. It is also useful to flag some members of a class heirachy as
    no public construct while leaving others able to be constructed.
    The interface provides no additional methods - it exists purely for
    detection purposes.
    To flag an object as no-public-construct, add INoPublicConstruct to its type
    definition then test for it in the public constructor using
    Supports(Self, INoPublicConstruct).

    object is passed to the constructor this object behaves as an aggregated
    object and defers to the container object for reference counting and
    interface queries. When nil is passed to the constructor or the
