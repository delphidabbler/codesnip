CodeSnip Data Directories
=========================

This file notes the paths of CodeSnip's configuration files and database
directories for each version of the program.

Configuration files
-------------------

For the whole of the life of the program there has been a per-user config file
to store settings that are different for each user. Since v1.9 there has also a
common config file to store application wide settings. The files were:

Up to v1.8.11
  %AppData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip\CodeSnip.ini

From v1.9 to v1.9.4
  %ProgramData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip\Common.ini
  %AppData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip\User.ini

All v2
  %ProgramData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip\Common.ini
  %AppData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip\User.ini

All v3
  %ProgramData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip\Common.ini
  %AppData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip\User.3.ini

From v4.0.0 to v4.0.2
  %ProgramData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip.4\Common.config
  %AppData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip.4\User.config

All v4 from v4.1.0
  standard edition:
    %ProgramData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip.4\Common.config
    %AppData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip.4\User.config
  portable edition:
    <exe-dir>\AppData\Common.config
    <exe-dir>\AppData\User.config

    %ProgramData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip.5\Common.config
    %AppData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip.5\User.config
  portable mode:

    <exe-dir>\AppData.5\User.config

Database directories
--------------------

The early beta and v1 releases of CodeSnip were simply viewer applications for
the online Code Snippets database and as such had a single directory containing
a read-only copy of the database. This is referred to below as the "Main"
database. For versions up to v1.8.11 each user had their own copy of the
database but from v1.9 a single copy of the database was shared among all users.

Version 2 added support for the user to enter their own snippets which were
maintained in a separate directory to the Code Snippets database files. This
arrangement continued through versions 3 and 4. The user-defined database is
referred to below as the "User" database. Each user had their own copy of the
user database while a single copy of the main database continued to be shared by
all users.

From version 5 there is only a single, user-editable, database. Each user has
their own copy.

The directories are:

To v1.8.11:
  Main: %AppData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip\Data
