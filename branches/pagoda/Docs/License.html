  <h3>2. License Grants and Conditions</h3>

  <h4>2.1. Grants</h4>

  <p>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive license:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p>under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
      modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
      Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
      part of a Larger Work; and</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
      for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its

    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>2.2. Effective Date</h4>

  <p>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
  become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
  distributes such Contribution.</p>

  <h4>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</h4>

  <p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
  this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
  distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
  Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
  Contributor:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p>for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
      or</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
      Version); or</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
      its Contributions.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
  or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
  notice requirements in Section 3.4).</p>

  <h4>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</h4>

  <p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
  distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
  (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
  under the terms of Section 3.3).</p>

  <h4>2.5. Representation</h4>

  <p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
  Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
  grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>

  <h4>2.6. Fair Use</h4>

  <p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
  applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
  equivalents.</p>

  <h4>2.7. Conditions</h4>

  <p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
  in Section 2.1.</p>

  <h3>3. Responsibilities</h3>

  <h4>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</h4>

  <p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
  of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
  they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
  restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.</p>

  <h4>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</h4>

  <p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p>such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
      Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
      the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form
      by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the
      cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
      License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
      license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
      recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</h4>

  <p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
  with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
  Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
  You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
  such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
  their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
  either this License or such Secondary License(s).</p>

  <h4>3.4. Notices</h4>

  <p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
  (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
  limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
  Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
  extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>

  <h4>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</h4>

  <p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
  Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
  of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
  warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
  alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
  disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
  jurisdiction.</p>

  <h3>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</h3>

  <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
  judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
  this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
  limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
  text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
  this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
  such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
  skill to be able to understand it.</p>

  <h3>5. Termination</h3>

  <h4>5.1.</h4>

  <p>The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
  if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
  compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
  Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
  ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
  non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
  come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies
  You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time
  You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
  Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
  of the notice.</p>

  <h4>5.2.</h4>

  <p>If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
  and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
  indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
  all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
  shall terminate.</p>

  <h4>5.3.</h4>

  <p>In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
  end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
  have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
  prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>

  <h3>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>

  <p><em>Covered Software is provided under this License on an &quot;as is&quot;
  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
  including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
  of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
  is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
  You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
  part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under
  this License except under this disclaimer.</em></p>

  <h3>7. Limitation of Liability</h3>

  <p><em>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or
  anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to
  You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages
  of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits,
  loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have
  been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of
  liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury
  resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law
  prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
  limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
  limitation may not apply to You.</em></p>

  <h3>8. Litigation</h3>

  <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
  courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place
  of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
  jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
  in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
  counter-claims.</p>

  <h3>9. Miscellaneous</h3>

  <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
  the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
  be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p>

  <h3>10. Versions of the License</h3>

  <h4>10.1. New Versions</h4>

  <p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
  publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
  distinguishing version number.</p>

  <h4>10.2. Effect of New Versions</h4>

  <p>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
  of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
  under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
  steward.</p>

  <h4>10.3. Modified Versions</h4>

  <p>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
  create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
  version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references
  to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified
  license differs from this License).</p>

  <h4>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses</h4>

  <p>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
  notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.</p>

  </ol>

  <h3>3. Distribution Obligations.</h3>

  <h4>3.1. Application of License.</h4>

  <p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
  by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The
  Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of
  this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1,
  and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
  You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
  version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
  recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
  offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.</p>

  <h4>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</h4>

  <p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
  available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the
  same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
  Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if
  made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available
  for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available,
  or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
  Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible
  for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
  Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</p>

  <h4>3.3. Description of Modifications.</h4>

  <p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
  documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of
  any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is
  derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
  Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source
  Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
  in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</p>

  <h4>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</h4>

  <h5>(a) Third Party Claims</h5>

  <p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
  intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by
  such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text
  file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which
  describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
  recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge
  after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
  Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
  makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
  appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those
  who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.</p>

  <h5>(b) Contributor APIs</h5>

  <p>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
  interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
  reasonably necessary to implement that <abbr>API</abbr>, Contributor must
  also include this information in the <span class="very-strong">Legal</span>
  file.</p>

  <h5>(c) Representations.</h5>

  <p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4
  (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
  Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
  to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>

  <h4>3.5. Required Notices.</h4>

  <p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
  Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code
  file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location
  (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such
  a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as
  a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate
  this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe
  recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may
  choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
  may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
  or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
  hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result
  of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>

  <h4>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</h4>

  <p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
  requirements of Sections  3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that
  Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
  version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
  including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
  of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
  Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
  Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of
  Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
  that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
  license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
  recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
  this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
  license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
  this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
  Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
  Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
  Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p>

  <h4>3.7. Larger Works.</h4>

  <p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
  not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
  single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
  License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>

  <h3>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</h3>

  <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
  judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
  this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations
  and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the
  <span class="very-strong">Legal</span> file described in Section 3.4 and must
  be included  with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent
  prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
  detailed for a  recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>

  <h3>5. Application of this License.</h3>

  <p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
  the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.</p>

  <h3>6. Versions of the License.</h3>

  <h4>6.1. New Versions</h4>

  <p>Netscape Communications Corporation (&quot;Netscape&quot;) may publish
  revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
  will be given a distinguishing version number.</p>

  <h4>6.2. Effect of New Versions</h4>

  <p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
  License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version.
  You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any
  subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than
  Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
  under this License.</p>

  <h4>6.3. Derivative Works</h4>

  <p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
  only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
  governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
  phrases &quot;Mozilla&quot;, &quot;MOZILLAPL&quot;, &quot;MOZPL&quot;,
  &quot;Netscape&quot;, &quot;MPL&quot;, &quot;NPL&quot; or any confusingly
  similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license
  differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version
  of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
  Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
  Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
  themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)</p>

  <h3>7. <strong class="very-strong">Disclaimer of warranty</strong></h3>

  <p><strong class="very-strong">Covered code is provided under this license
  on an &quot;as is&quot; basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed
  or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the covered code is
  free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
  non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
  covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any
  respect, you (not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the
  cost of any necessary servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of
  warranty constitutes an essential part of this license. No use of any covered
  code is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.</strong></p>

  <h3>8. Termination</h3>

  <p>8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
  breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
  Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
  License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
  termination of this License shall survive.</p>

  <p>8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
  (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
  Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
  action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
    any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
    Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
    Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt
    of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
    agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications
    made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with
    respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60
    days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
    mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is
    not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections
    2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day
    notice period specified above.</li>

    <li>any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
    Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
    rights  granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b)
    are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
    distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
  that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
  any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
  prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
  value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2
  shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment
  or license.</p>

  <p>8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end
  user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
  validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall
  survive termination.</p>

  <h3>9. <strong class="very-strong">Limitation of liability</strong></h3>

  <p><strong class="very-strong">Under no circumstances and under no legal
  theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall
  you, the initial developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of
  covered code, or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to any person
  for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
  character including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work
  stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
  damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the
  possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
  liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence
  to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do
  not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages,
  so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.</strong></p>

  <h3>10. <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> government end users</h3>

  <p>The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined
  in 48 <abbr>C.F.R.</abbr> 2.101 (<abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 1995),
  consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial
  computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48
  <abbr>C.F.R.</abbr> 12.212 (<abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 1995).
  Consistent with 48 <abbr>C.F.R.</abbr> 12.212 and 48 <abbr>C.F.R.</abbr>
  227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all <abbr>U.S.</abbr> Government
  End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.</p>

  <h3>11. Miscellaneous</h3>

  <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
  enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
  (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
  its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
  party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in
  the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
  subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
  California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the
  losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court
  costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the
  United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
  expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of
  a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
  License.</p>

  <h3>12. Responsibility for claims</h3>

  <p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
  responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
  utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
  Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
  basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
  admission of liability.</p>

  <h3>13. Multiple-licensed code</h3>

  <p>Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
  &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot;. &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot; means that the
  Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
  Your choice of the <abbr>MPL</abbr> or the alternative licenses, if any,
  specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.</p>

<pre>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>

  <h3>Preamble</h3>

  <p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
  share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
  to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software &ndash; to make
  sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License
  applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
  program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation
  software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can
  apply it to your programs, too.</p>

  <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
  General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
  distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
  that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
  the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
  can do these things.</p>

  <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
  deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
  restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
  copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>

  <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
  for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must
  make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must
  show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>

  <p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
  offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
  and/or modify the software.</p>

  <p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
  everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
  software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
  know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
  by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>

  <p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
  wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
  individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
  everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>

  <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow.</p>

  <h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>

  <p><strong>0.</strong> This License applies to any program or other work which
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
  under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,
  below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the
  Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright
  law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
  verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
  &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>

  <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the
  Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if
  its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
  been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
  Program does.</p>

  <p><strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
  Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
  notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
  this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
  of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

  <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>

  <p><strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or
  any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
  provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>a)</strong> You must cause the modified files to
  carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any
  change.</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>b)</strong> You must cause any work that you
  distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from
  the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
  third parties under the terms of this License.</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>c)</strong> If the modified program normally reads
  commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for
  such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there
  is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users
  may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how
  to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
  interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based
  on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>

  <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
  sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
  considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
  and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
  which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
  the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>

  <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
  rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
  right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
  the Program.</p>

  <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
  storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
  of this License.</p>

  <p><strong>3.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work
  based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
  terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
  following:</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>a)</strong> Accompany it with the complete
  corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
  the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
  interchange; or,</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>b)</strong> Accompany it with a written offer,
  valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more
  than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
  machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
  software interchange; or,</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>c)</strong> Accompany it with the information you
  received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
  alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
  received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
  accord with Subsection b above.)</p>

  <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
  modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
  the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
  definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
  installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source
  code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
  either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and
  so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
  component itself accompanies the executable.</p>

  <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
  even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
  object code.</p>

  <p><strong>4.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
  Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
  to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
  automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
  their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
  compliance.</p>

  <p><strong>5.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since you
  have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
  by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
  distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate
  your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
  copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>

  <p><strong>6.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work
  based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
  terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
  recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
  enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p>

  <p><strong>7.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation
  of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
  that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
  the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
  obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
  of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
  you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>

  <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
  the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>

  <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
  or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
  section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
  distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
  distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
  distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
  choice.</p>

  <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
  consequence of the rest of this License.</p>

  <p><strong>8.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
  restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
  License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
  not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as
  if written in the body of this License.</p>

  <p><strong>9.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
  new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
  detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

  <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
  later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
  Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this
  License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
  Foundation.</p>

  <p>strong>10.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into
  other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
  author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
  preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
  promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

  <p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

  <p><strong>11.</strong>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE
  IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
  PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
  EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
  RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

  <p><strong>12.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
  AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
  MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
  NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
  SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH
  ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
  THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

  <h3>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

  <h3>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

  <p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free
  software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

  <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
  attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
  exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is
  found.</p>

<pre>
<var>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</var>
Copyright (C) <var>yyyy</var>  <var>name of author</var>

but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

</pre>

  <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
  mail.</p>

  <p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when
  it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

  <p>The hypothetical commands <samp>'show w'</samp> and <samp>'show c'</samp>
  should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course,
  the commands you use may be called something other than <samp>'show w'</samp>
  and <samp>'show c'</samp>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items
  &ndash; whatever suits your program.</p>

  <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>

  <p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
  proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
  library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
  License instead of this License.</p>

  <p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

  <p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  &lt;<a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p>

  <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
  license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

  <p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the
  terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License,
  supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>

  <h3 id="lgpl-3.0-section0">0. Additional Definitions.</h3>

  <p>As used herein, &ldquo;this License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU
  Lesser General Public License, and the &ldquo;GNU GPL&rdquo; refers to
  version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Library&rdquo; refers to a covered work governed by this
  License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>

  <p>An &ldquo;Application&rdquo; is any work that makes use of an interface
  provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of
  using an interface provided by the Library.</p>

  <p>A &ldquo;Combined Work&rdquo; is a work produced by combining or linking an
  Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with
  which the Combined Work was made is also called the &ldquo;Linked
  Version&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;Minimal Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a Combined Work means
  the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
  portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
  Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Application Code&rdquo; for a Combined Work means
  the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and
  utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
  Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>

  <h3 id="lgpl-3.0-section1">1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</h3>

  <p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
  without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>

  <h3 id="lgpl-3.0-section2">2. Conveying Modified Versions.</h3>

  <p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
  refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
  facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then
  you may convey a copy of the modified version:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or
    data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose
    remains meaningful, or</li>

    <li>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
    License applicable to that copy.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3 id="lgpl-3.0-section3">3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library
  Header Files.</h3>

  <p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a
  header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under
  terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not
  limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or
  small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length),
  you do both of the following:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
    License.</li>

    <li>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
    document.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3 id="lgpl-3.0-section4">4. Combined Works.</h3>

  <p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
  together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
  Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
  such modifications, if you also do each of the following:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
    License.</li>

    <li>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
    license document.</li>

    <li>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
    include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
    a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
    document.</li>

    <li>d) Do one of the following:

      <ul>

        <li>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for,
        and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the
        Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
        modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU
        GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.</li>

        <li>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy
        of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b
        will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
        interface-compatible with the Linked Version.</li>

      </ul>

    </li>

    <li>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
    required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and
    only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute
    a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
    the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
    option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
    Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
    4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified
    by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)</li>

  </ul>

  <h3 id="lgpl-3.0-section5">5. Combined Libraries.</h3>

  <p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side
  by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are
  not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a
  combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the
  following:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
    the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under
    the terms of this License.</li>

    <li>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
    work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
    uncombined form of the same work.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3 id="lgpl-3.0-section6">6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License.</h3>

  <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
  GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
  new problems or concerns.</p>

  <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as
  you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you
  have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published
  version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
  the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
  Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

  <p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
  future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
  proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
  authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</p>

  <h2>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>

  <p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

  <p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  &lt;<a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p>

  <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
  license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

  <h3 id="gpl-3.0-preamble">Preamble</h3>

  <p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and
  other kinds of works.</p>

  <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
  take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU
  General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
  change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for
  all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public
  License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released
  this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>

  <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
  General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
  distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
  receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
  software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can
  do these things.</p>

  <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
  rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain
  responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
  it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>

  <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
  for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you
  received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>

  <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
  assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you
  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>

  <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that
  there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors'
  sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that
  their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous
  versions.</p>

  <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
  versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.
  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom
  to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the
  area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
  unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit
  the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other
  domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
  versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>

  <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
  should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
  general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
  danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
  proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
  render the program non-free.</p>

  <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow.</p>

  <h3 id="gpl-3.0-terms">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section0">0. Definitions.</h4>

  <p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
  License.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
  kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
  this License. Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.
  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and &ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or
  organizations.</p>

  <p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of
  the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
  an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo;
  of the earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.</p>

  <p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work
  based on the Program.</p>

  <p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that,
  without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer
  or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with
  or without modification), making available to the public, and in some
  countries other activities as well.</p>

  <p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables
  other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>

  <p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal
  Notices&rdquo; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently
  visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
  tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent
  that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
  License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a
  list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list
  meets this criterion.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section1">1. Source Code.</h4>

  <p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the
  work for making modifications to it. &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any
  non-source form of a work.</p>

  <p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an
  official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely
  used among developers working in that language.</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything,
  other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component,
  and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to
  implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the
  public in source code form. A &ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context,
  means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
  specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
  compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run
  it.</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means
  all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
  run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
  activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
  general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
  unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
  associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
  libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
  designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
  between those subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>

  <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
  regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</p>

  <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
  work.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section2">2. Basic Permissions.</h4>

  <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
  on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
  unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this
  License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.
  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as
  provided by copyright law.</p>

  <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
  without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may
  convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make
  modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running
  those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in
  conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus
  making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
  behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from
  making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with
  you.</p>

  <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
  conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
  unnecessary.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section3">3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From
  Anti-Circumvention Law.</h4>

  <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
  under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
  copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
  restricting circumvention of such measures.</p>

  <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
  effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
  work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the
  work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'
  legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section4">4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>

  <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
  it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
  on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating
  that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7
  apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;
  and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

  <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you
  may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section5">5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>

  <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
  it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
  provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
    and giving a relevant date.</li>

    <li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
    under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
    requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &ldquo;keep intact all
    notices&rdquo;.</li>

    <li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
    apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of
    the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
    License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it
    does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>

    <li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not
    make them do so.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
  which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are
  not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
  storage or distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the
  compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or
  legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works
  permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
  License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section6">6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4>

  <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
  sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
  Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
  ways:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding
    Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software
    interchange.</li>

    <li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer,
    valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare
    parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who
    possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for
    all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
    durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a
    price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a
    network server at no charge.</li>

    <li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is
    allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the
    object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.</li>

    <li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
    (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding
    Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need
    not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the
    object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
    Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a
    third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
    maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding
    Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
    needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>

    <li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the
    work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection
    6d.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
  the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in
  conveying the object code work.</p>

  <p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a
  &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any tangible personal property
  which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2)
  anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining
  whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in
  favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,
  &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a typical or common use of that class of
  product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in
  which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the
  product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has
  substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
  represent the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any
  methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
  install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product
  from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code
  is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has
  been made.</p>

  <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a
  transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is
  transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of
  how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under
  this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this
  requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the
  ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the
  work has been installed in ROM).</p>

  <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
  work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
  Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be
  denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
  operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
  across the network.</p>

  <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
  accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and
  with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must
  require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section7">7. Additional Terms.</h4>

  <p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of
  this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
  treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they
  are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part
  of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but
  the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
  additional permissions.</p>

  <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
  additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
  permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
  you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added
  by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
  permission.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add
  to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
  material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
    of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>

    <li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
    displayed by works containing it; or</li>

    <li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable
    ways as different from the original version; or</li>

    <li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or</li>

    <li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
    names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>

    <li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
    by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
    contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
    that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and
    authors.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further
  restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed
  by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may
  remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but
  permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered
  work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that
  the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>

  <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
  place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that
  apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
  terms.</p>

  <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form
  of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
  requirements apply either way.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section8">8. Termination.</h4>

  <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
  under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
  and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any
  patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).</p>

  <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from
  a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and
  until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and
  (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation
  by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>

  <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
  permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
  reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation
  of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
  violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>

  <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
  License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated,
  you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section
  10.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section9">9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h4>

  <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
  copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely
  as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy
  likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License
  grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions
  infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying
  or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to
  do so.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section10">10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream
  Recipients.</h4>

  <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
  license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
  subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
  third parties with this License.</p>

  <p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control
  of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
  organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
  results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
  receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
  party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
  paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work
  from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with
  reasonable efforts.</p>

  <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
  granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
  license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
  this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
  counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
  making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
  portion of it.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section11">11. Patents.</h4>

  <p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under
  this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work
  thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor
  version&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims
  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
  acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License,
  of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include
  claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
  of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
  &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a
  manner consistent with the requirements of this License.</p>

  <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
  license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
  offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of
  its contributor version.</p>

  <p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any
  express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for
  patent infringement). To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a party
  means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against
  the party.</p>

  <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
  the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free
  of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
  network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
  cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
  yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)
  arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
  extend the patent license to downstream recipients. &ldquo;Knowingly
  relying&rdquo; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent
  license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use
  of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
  patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>

  <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
  you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant
  a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing
  them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
  then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients
  of the covered work and works based on it.</p>

  <p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include
  within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned
  on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted
  under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
  arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing
  software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent
  of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
  grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
  discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered
  work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for
  and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
  covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license
  was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>

  <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
  implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
  available to you under applicable patent law.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section12">12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>

  <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
  you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work
  so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
  other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at
  all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty
  for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way
  you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain
  entirely from conveying the Program.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section13">13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public
  License.</h4>

  <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
  link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
  GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey
  the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
  part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU
  Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a
  network will apply to the combination as such.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section14">14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>

  <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
  GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
  new problems or concerns.</p>

  <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
  specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License
  &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
  following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any
  later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
  not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
  any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

  <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
  the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of
  acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
  the Program.</p>

  <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
  holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section15">15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4>

  <p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
  LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
  SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section16">16. Limitation of Liability.</h4>

  <p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
  ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
  PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
  OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
  DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
  A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
  HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

  <h4 id="gpl-3.0-section17">17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h4>

  <p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
  cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts
  shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all
  civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or
  assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a
  fee.</p>

  <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

  <h3 id="gpl-3.0-howto">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

  <p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free
  software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

  <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
  attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the
  exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is
  found.</p>

<pre>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.</pre>

  <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
  mail.</p>

  <p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
  like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

<pre>    &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.</pre>

  <p>The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might
  be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an
  &ldquo;about box&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
  if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if
  necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU
  GPL, see &lt;<a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/"
  >http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>&gt;.</p>

  <p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
  into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may
  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
  library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
  License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;<a

  <h3>License</h3>

  <p>This software, including documentation, source code, object code and/or
  additional materials (TGIFImage) is owned by Anders Melander (the Author).</p>

  <p>This License does not provide you with title or ownership of TGIFImage, but
  only a right of limited use as outlined in this License agreement. The Author
  hereby grants you a non-exclusive, royalty free license to use TGIFImage as
  set forth below:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>integrate TGIFImage with your Applications, subject to the
    redistribution terms below.</li>

    <li>modify or adapt TGIFImage in whole or in part for the development of
    Applications based on TGIFImage.</li>

    <li>use portions of the TGIFImage source code or TGIFImage Demo Programs in
    your own products.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Redistribution rights</h3>

  <p>You are granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free right to reproduce and
  redistribute executable files created using TGIFImage (the Executable Code)
  in conjunction with software products that you develop and/or market (the
  Applications).</p>

  <h4>Restrictions</h4>

  <p>Without the expressed, written consent of the Author, you may NOT:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>distribute modified versions of TGIFImage, in whole or in part.</li>

    <li>rent or lease TGIFImage.</li>

    <li>sell any portion of TGIFImage on its own, without integrating it into

  <h3>Limited warranty</h3>

  <p>There is no warranty or other guarantee of fitness for this software, it is
  provided solely &quot;as is&quot;. Bug reports or fixes may be sent to the
  Author, who may or may not act on them as he desires.</p>

  <h3>LZW license</h3>

  <p>GIF (and thus TGIFImage) uses an adaption of the LZW compression algorithm
  for image compression. The LZW algorithm is patented by UNISYS. Unfortunately
  UNISYS requires royalty payment for all software that uses the LZW
  algorithm.</p>

  <p>To avoid the use of the LZW algorithm for writing GIFs, TGIFImage can write
  GIFs using a LZW compatible RLE compression method. See the
  <var>TGIFImage.Compression</var> property for more information. There are
  conflicting opinions on whether a LZW license is required to read GIFs. Some
  patent lawyers are of the opinion that the LZW patent does not cover LZW
  decoders, but others disagree. If this matters to you, you should contact your
  own lawyer.</p>

  <p>For information regarding UNISYS' view on the use of LZW in commercial
  software, please read the License Information on GIF and Other LZW-based
  Technologies. The UNISYS patent on the LZW algorithm may or may not apply to
  you depending on the laws of your country. Personally I have less than warm
  feelings for Unisys and their patent and I don't care if you have a license or
  not.</p>

  <p>The LZW patent <span style="text-decoration:line-through">expires</span>
  expired in 2004.</p>

  <h3>Credit of work</h3>

  <p>If you redistribute TGIFImage in binary form (i.e. as a library or linked
  into an application), the accompanying documentation (e.g. readme file, help
  file or about-box) should state that This software is based, in part, on the
  work of Anders Melander or words to that effect.</p>

  <p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
  COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENSE&quot;). THE WORK IS
  PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER
  THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.</p>

  <p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
  BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
  CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
  IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</p>

  <p><strong>1. Definitions</strong></p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li><strong>&quot;Adaptation&quot;</strong> means a work based upon the
    Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
    adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
    recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived
    from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not
    be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the
    avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
    phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
    image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the
    purpose of this License.</li>

    <li><strong>&quot;Collection&quot;</strong> means a collection of literary
    or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
    phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works
    listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which
    the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or
    more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
    in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work
    that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as

    >http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses</a> that has been approved by

    at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same
    purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and,
    (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made
    available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons

    be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a
    book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic

  intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
  arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection

  <p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of
  this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright)
  license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;</li>

    <li>to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
    label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
    original Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The original
    work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or a modification could
    indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;</li>

    <li>to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
    Collections; and,</li>

    <li>to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.</li>

    <li>
      For the avoidance of doubt:
      <ol type="i">
        <li><strong>Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes</strong>. In those
        jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
        statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License;</li>

        <li><strong>Waivable Compulsory License Schemes</strong>. In those
        jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
        statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor
        waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
        You of the rights granted under this License; and,</li>

        <li><strong>Voluntary License Schemes</strong>. The Licensor waives the
        right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
        the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You
        of the rights granted under this License.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
  known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
  modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
  media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
  by Licensor are hereby reserved.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong> The license granted in Section 3 above
  is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
    this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
    restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
    Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
    License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
    that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
    copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work
    from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
    the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
    Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work
    itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
    Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section
    4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
    credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.</li>

    <li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
    terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the
    same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
    license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
    License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));
    (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation
    under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms
    of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the
    licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the &quot;Applicable
    License&quot;), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License
    generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or
    the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms
    on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the
    ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to
    that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must
    keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the
    disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
    Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a
    recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
    require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject
    to the terms of the Applicable License.</li>

    <li>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
    4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
    Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
    Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&quot;Attribution
    Parties&quot;) in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
    reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
    Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
    does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
    Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an
    Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
    (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or
    &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The
    credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable
    manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection,
    at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
    contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the
    credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner
    set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
    implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
    endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
    appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
    prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.</li>

    <li>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
    action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original
    Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
    e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of
    this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
    distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial
    to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or
    not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
    the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
    under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
    otherwise.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p>

  <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
  OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
  CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
  WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
  DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
  DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

  <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED
  BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL
  THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
  HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

  <p><strong>7. Termination</strong></p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from
    You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
    provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
    licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
    License.</li>

    <li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong></p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
    and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.</li>

    <li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.</li>

    <li>If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</li>

    <li>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
    signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.</li>

    <li>This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
    written agreement of the Licensor and You.</li>

    <li>The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
    the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
    1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
    WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
    Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
    take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
    sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
    the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
    additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
    deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
    restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.</li>

  <p><strong>1. Definitions</strong></p>

  <ol type="a">

    <li><strong>&quot;Collective Work&quot;</strong> means a work, such as a
    periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its
    entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,

    where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the
    synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
    (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose
    of this License.</li>

  <p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of
  this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright)
  license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:</p>

        other jurisdictions).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties</strong>. For the
    avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the

    with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
    publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
    any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
    the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not
    sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
    License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
    publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work
    with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
    manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
    require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to
    the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from
    any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective
    Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a
    Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
    clause 4(b), as requested.</li>

    <li>If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You
    must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
    Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the
    Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a
    sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's
    copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of
    such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent
    reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
    Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in
    the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
    the Derivative Work (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original
    Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original
    Author&quot;). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work,
    at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship
    credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
    comparable authorship credit.</li>

  </ol>
  <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p>

  <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
  OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
  CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
  WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
  DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
  DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

  <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED
  BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL
  THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
  HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </p>

  <p><strong>7. Termination</strong> </p>

  <ol type="a">

    <li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective
    Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance
    with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
    termination of this License.</li>

    <li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong> </p>

  <ol type="a">

    <li>Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
    Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
    on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.</li>

    <li>Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
    Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the
    same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.</li>

    <li>If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</li>

    <li>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
    signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.</li>

    <li>This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
    written agreement of the Licensor and You.</li>
