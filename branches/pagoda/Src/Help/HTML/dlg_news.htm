    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is displayed from the <em>Help | CodeSnip News</em> menu
      item.
    </p>
    <p>
      It shows the latest news about <em>CodeSnip</em> and the online database.
      The news is obtained from <em>CodeSnip</em>'s online RSS news feed. The
      titles of most items are click-able and will display a web page relevant
      to the news item when clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maximum age of the news items is shown at the top of the window. By
      default this is 92 days. You can change this by clicking the
      <em>Change</em> button, which will display the <a
        href="dlg_prefs_news.htm"
      >News</a> tab of the <a
        href="dlg_preferences.htm"
      >Preferences</a> dialogue box. Enter a new value there and click
      <em>OK</em>. If the value has changed the news will be re-loaded, showing
      items from the date range specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the news feed is not available or there is an error, a message to that
      effect is displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can display the RSS feed in your default web browser by clicking the
      <em>RSS Feed</em> button. Depending on your browser, you may be able to
      subscribe to the feed from there.
