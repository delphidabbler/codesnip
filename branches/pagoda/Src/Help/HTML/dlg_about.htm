    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is accessed from the <em>Help | About</em> menu option
      and displays information about <em>CodeSnip</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program's version number is displayed in the heading of the dialogue
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition the dialogue has two tabs, each of which is described below.
    </p>
    <h2>
      1. About The Program
    </h2>
    <p>
      This tab shows:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        The program's copyright and licensing information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Credits and Attributions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      2. Paths
    </h2>
    <p>
      This tab gives information about various directories used by
      <em>CodeSnip</em>. They are:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        <em>Install Directory</em> &ndash; the directory where <em>CodeSnip</em>
        is installed or, more accurately, the directory from which the current
        instance of the program was executed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>User Database Directory</em> &ndash; the directory containing the
        current user's database.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The full path of any directory may be shortened if there is not enough
      room to display it all. In this case a pop-up window will display the path
      in full if the mouse cursor is hovered over the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking the button to the right of each directory will open that
      directory in Windows Explorer. If the directory does not exist then the
      button will be disabled.
    </p>
  </body>
