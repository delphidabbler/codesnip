    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      There are three options ways for copying a snippet of code to the
      clipboard.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Copy Information
    </h2>
    <p>
      Copies all the information about the selected snippet to the clipboard in
      both plain text and rich text format. The rich text format version syntax
      highlights the source code.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option applies to any kind of snippet.
    </p>
      Simply select a snippet in the <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview
      Pane</a> and then use the <em>Edit | Copy Information</em> menu option or
      press <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+I</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Copy Annotated Source
    </h2>
    <p>
      Copies either a single snippet or all the snippets associated with a tag
      to the clipboard. Snippets are copied as valid compilable Pascal
      fragments. Lists of any required units or other routines are included as
      comments. A snippet's description may be included as a comment, depending
      on the commenting style specified on the
      <a href="dlg_prefs_sourcecode.htm">Code Formatting tab</a> of the
      <a href="dlg_preferences.htm">Preferences dialogue box</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option applies only to <a href="snippet_routine.htm">routine</a>
      snippets or to routine snippets associated with a tag (any non-routine
      snippets with the required tag are ignored).
    </p>
    <p>
      To use this option simply select a suitable snippet or tag in the
      <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a> then choose the <em>Edit |
      Copy Annotated Source</em> menu option or press
      <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+N</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both plain text and as rich text copies are placed on the clipboard with
      the rich text version being syntax highlighted.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Copy Source Code
    </h2>
    <p>
      Copies only the source code of the selected snippet in plain text and in
      rich text format. Again the rich text copy is syntax highlighted. The
      source is exactly as it appears in the <a href="detail_pane.htm">Details
      Pane</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option applies to any kind of snippet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select a snippet in the <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a> and
      then use the <em>Edit | Copy Source Code</em> menu option or press
      <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+U</span>.
    </p>
