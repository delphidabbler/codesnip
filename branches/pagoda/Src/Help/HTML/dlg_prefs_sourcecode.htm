    This tab of the <a href="dlg_preferences.htm">Preferences</a> dialogue box
    is used configure the format of source code that <em>CodeSnip</em> writes

    Source code formatting
  </h2>
  <p>
    Descriptions of snippets can be included as comments in generated source
    code. The placing of such comments can be customised using the
    <em>Commenting style</em> drop down list. Options are:
  </p>
  <ul class="unspaced">
    <li>
    <em>No descriptive comments</em> &ndash; descriptions are not included.
    </li>
    <li>
    <em>Comments after snippet header</em> &ndash; comments appear between
    a snippet's header and the body of the snippet. For functions and
    procedures the header is the function or procedure prototype. For
    types and constants the comment is placed after the
    <strong>type</strong> or <strong>const</strong> keyword and before any
    other code.
    </li>
    <li>
    <em>Comments before snippet</em> &ndash; comments are placed before the
    snippet. The snippet's name is included in the comment.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A preview of the comment style is displayed below the drop down list.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some snippets have multi-paragraph descriptions, all of which would normally
    appear in the snippet's comment in generated code. You can limit the comment
    to use just the first paragraph of the snippet's description by ticking the
    <em>Truncate comments to one paragraph</em> check box.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Descriptive comments are not applicable to
    <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">free-form</a> snippets.
  </p>
  <h2>
    File formatting
  </h2>
  <p>
    The default format of output files is configurable. The available output
    types are HTML, rich text and two types of unformatted text, i.e. Pascal
    files and plain text files. You choose the default output type using the
    <em>Output file type</em> drop down list.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML and rich text file types can be syntax highlighted. To enable this
    option check the <em>Enable syntax highlighting</em> check box. The
    highlighting can be customised using the
    <a href="dlg_prefs_hiliter.htm">Syntax Highlighter</a> tab.
