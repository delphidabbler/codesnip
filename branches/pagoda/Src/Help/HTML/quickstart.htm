    </h1>
    <p>
      This is a guide to getting up and running quickly with <em>CodeSnip</em>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Download the database
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you have not already done so, you need to get an up to date copy of
      the <em>CodeSnip</em> database. You will know if this is the case because
      the program will display a message to that effect when it first starts.
      Use the <a
       href="dlg_update.htm">Update From Web</a> dialogue box, reached from the
      <em>Database | Update From Web</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need <em>CodeSnip</em> to access the internet via a Proxy Server
      you should use the <em>Tools | Proxy Server</em> menu option and enter
      information and the proxy in the resulting <a
       href="dlg_proxyserver.htm">Proxy Server Configuration</a> dialogue box.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Customise the Database
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can add your own snippets to the database. These snippets are held
      separately to the main database and are not affected by database updates.
      If you wish you can submit user defined code to be considered for
      inclusion in the main database.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add, edit and delete snippets using the appropriate menu items on the
      <em>Database</em> menu. You can also save, backup and restore the user
      database from this menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snippets can be associated with one or more tags that makes grouping and
      finding them easier.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Navigating the database
    </h2>
    <p>
      All the snippets in the database are displayed in the
      <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a>, grouped in different ways
      depending on which tab is selected. Select the name of a snippet in the
      Overview Pane to display its source code, description and other
      information in the Detail Pane. Any snippets required to compile
      the displayed snippet are listed in the &quot;Required snippets&quot;
      section. Clicking a snippet's name displays its details. Similar
      snippets are accessible in the &quot;See also&quot; section. The
      compilers the snippet is known to compile with are indicated at the bottom
      of the display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking a section heading in the <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview
      Pane</a> displays a table listing all the snippets in that section in the
      current tab of the <a href="detail_pane.htm">Detail Pane</a>. Clicking any
      snippet name will display the snippet's details in a similar way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Items in the <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a> can be
      displayed in a new tab in the <a href="detail_pane.htm">Details Pane</a>
      either by <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl</span>-clicking the item or by
      creating a new, empty tab by pressing
      <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+T</span> before clicking the required item.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Searching the database
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can search the database for specific words, for snippets that
      compile (or don't compile) under certain compilers or for
      cross-referenced snippets. Use the <a href="dlg_findtext.htm">Find
      Text</a>, <a href="dlg_findcompiler.htm">Find Compiler</a> or
      <a href="dlg_findxrefs.htm">File Cross References</a> dialogue boxes to
      perform a search. These dialogues are accessed via the
      <a href="menu_search.htm">Search</a> menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a search has been performed only those snippets that are found are
      listed in the <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a>. When a text
      search is performed the found words are highlighted in the detail pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The list of snippets resulting from a search can be stored in a file for
      later restoration. Use the <em>Save Selection</em> and <em>Load
      Selection</em> options from the <em>File</em> menu to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cancel a search and view all the database again, select the <em>Search
      | Show All</em> menu item.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Favourite Snippets
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you have snippets that you return to frequently you can make them
      &quot;favourites&quot; by selecting the <em>Snippets | Add To
      Favourites</em> menu option or by pressing
      <span class="smallcaps">Shift+Alt+F</span> when the snippet is displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Favourite snippets are displayed in the
      <a href="dlg_favourites.htm">Favourites</a> dialogue box which is
      accessed from the <em>Snippets | Show Favourites</em> menu option or by
      pressing <span class="smallcaps">F4</span>. Display the snippet you want
      by double clicking it. The snippet will then be displayed in the main
      window's <a href="detail_pane.htm">detail pane</a> as normal. You can also
      use the dialogue box to remove any unwanted favourites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="dlg_favourites.htm">Favourites</a> dialogue box is non-modal
      and can be left displayed alongside the main <em>CodeSnip</em> window
      for easy access to favourites. By default the dialogue box fades to
      semi-transparency when the main window is being used, but this can be
      changed if desired.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Test Compiling Snippets
    </h2>
    <p>
      When any snippet is selected you can test it with any supported compilers
      currently installed on your computer, provided it is not a
      <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">free-form</a> snippet. To do this you must
      first have configured <em>CodeSnip</em> to work with your compilers by
      providing the required information in the
      <a href="dlg_configcompilers.htm">Configure Compilers</a> dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>
      To perform a test compilation select the required snippet in the Overview
      pane and choose <em>Compile | Test Compile Snippet</em> menu option. The
      program will then compile the snippet and display the result in the
      <a href="dlg_testcompile.htm">Test Compile Results</a> dialogue box. Full
      details of any compiler errors or warnings can be displayed from this
      dialogue box.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Exporting Snippets
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> can export snippets or complete units, as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any selected routine can be exported to a file using the
        <a href="dlg_savesnippet.htm">Save Annotated Source</a> dialogue box
        accessed from the <em>File | Save Annotated Source</em> menu option.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plain text and syntax highlighted rich text copies of selected snippets
        can be copied to the clipboard via the <em>Edit | Copy Annotated
        Source</em> or <em>Edit | Copy Source Code</em> menu options.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete Pascal units can be generated and written to file. The unit
        will contain all the currently selected snippets (i.e. those displayed
        in the <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a>). You can
        explicitly specify the selected snippets by using the
        <a href="dlg_selectroutines.htm">Select Snippets</a> dialogue box
        available via <em>Search | Select Snippets</em>. The unit is configured
        and saved from the <a href="dlg_saveunit.htm">Save Unit</a> dialogue
        box, displayed from the <em>File | Save Unit</em> menu option.
      </li>
      <li>
        User-defined snippets can be exported to a file that can be imported by
        other <em>CodeSnip</em> users.
      </li>
    </ul>
