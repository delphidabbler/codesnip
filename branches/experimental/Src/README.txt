This folder is a receptacle for all experimental source code.

It is organised into sub-folders as follows:

  * Database

    Experimental development of an new database engine for CodeSnip. See the
    README file in the folder for more information.

  * SyntaxHighlighting

    Experimental development of an entirely new syntax highlighter for CodeSnip
    using code from the SynEdit project. Will permit support for different
    languages and provide a new syntax highlighted code editor. See the README
    file in the folder for more info.

  * TrunkSrc

    A copy of the Src folder of trunk made at r3021. This is used to allow
    existing source code to be linked in to experimental code. Try to avoid
    modifying this code. If it is necessary carefully comment the modifications,
    preferably using some form of TODO comment.
