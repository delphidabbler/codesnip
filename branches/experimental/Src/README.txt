This folder is a recepticle for all experimental source code.

It is organised into sub-folders as follows:

* TrunkSrc
  A copy of the Src folder of trunk made at r3021. This is used to allow
  existing source code to be linked in to experimental code. Try to avoid
  modifying this code. If it is necessary carefully comment the modifications,
  preferrably using some form of TODO comment.

* SyntaxHighlighter
  Experimental development of an entirely new syntax highlighter for CodeSnip
  using code from the SynEdit project. Will permit support for different
  languages and provide a new syntax highlighted code editor. See the README
  file in the folder for more info.
