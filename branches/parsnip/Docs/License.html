    You may also modify <em>CodeSnip</em> as you wish and you may distribute

  <h3>2. License Grants and Conditions</h3>

  <h4>2.1. Grants</h4>

  <p>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive license:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p>under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
      modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
      Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
      part of a Larger Work; and</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
      for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
      Contributions or its Contributor Version.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>2.2. Effective Date</h4>

  <p>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
  become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
  distributes such Contribution.</p>

  <h4>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</h4>

  <p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
  this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
  distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
  Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
  Contributor:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p>for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
      or</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
      Version); or</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
      its Contributions.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
  or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
  notice requirements in Section 3.4).</p>

  <h4>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</h4>

  <p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
  distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
  (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
  under the terms of Section 3.3).</p>

  <h4>2.5. Representation</h4>

  <p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
  Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
  grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>

  <h4>2.6. Fair Use</h4>

  <p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
  applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
  equivalents.</p>

  <h4>2.7. Conditions</h4>

  <p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
  in Section 2.1.</p>

  <h3>3. Responsibilities</h3>

  <h4>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</h4>

  <p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
  of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
  they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
  restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.</p>

  <h4>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</h4>

  <p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p>such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
      Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
      the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form
      by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the
      cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
      License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
      license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
      recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</h4>

  <p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
  with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
  Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
  You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
  such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
  their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
  either this License or such Secondary License(s).</p>

  <h4>3.4. Notices</h4>

  <p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
  (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
  limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
  Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
  extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>

  <h4>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</h4>

  <p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
  Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
  of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
  warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
  alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
  disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
  jurisdiction.</p>

  <h3>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</h3>

  <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
  judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
  this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
  limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
  text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
  this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
  such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
  skill to be able to understand it.</p>

  <h3>5. Termination</h3>

  <h4>5.1.</h4>

  <p>The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
  if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
  compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
  Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
  ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
  non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
  come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies
  You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time
  You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
  Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
  of the notice.</p>

  <h4>5.2.</h4>

  <p>If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
  and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
  indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
  all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
  shall terminate.</p>

  <h4>5.3.</h4>

  <p>In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
  end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
  have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
  prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>

  <h3>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>

  <p><em>Covered Software is provided under this License on an &quot;as is&quot;
  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
  including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
  of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
  is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
  You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
  part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under
  this License except under this disclaimer.</em></p>

  <h3>7. Limitation of Liability</h3>

  <p><em>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or
  anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to
  You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages
  of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits,
  loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have
  been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of
  liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury
  resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law
  prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
  limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
  limitation may not apply to You.</em></p>

  <h3>8. Litigation</h3>

  <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
  courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place
  of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
  jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
  in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
  counter-claims.</p>

  <h3>9. Miscellaneous</h3>

  <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
  the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
  be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p>

  <h3>10. Versions of the License</h3>

  <h4>10.1. New Versions</h4>

  <p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
  publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
  distinguishing version number.</p>

  <h4>10.2. Effect of New Versions</h4>

  <p>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
  of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
  under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
  steward.</p>

  <h4>10.3. Modified Versions</h4>

  <p>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
  create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
  version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references
  to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified
  license differs from this License).</p>

  <h4>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses</h4>

  <p>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
  notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.</p>

  non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
  claims:</p>

  <ol type="a">

    <li>under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,

    <li>under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of
    Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale,
    and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof).</li>

    <li>the licenses granted in this Section 2.1 (a) and (b) are effective on
    the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms
    of this License.</li>

    <li>Notwithstanding Section 2.1 (b) above, no patent license is granted: 1)
    for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the
    Original Code; or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the
    Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other
    software or devices.</li>

  </ol>

  <h4>2.2. Contributor Grant.</h4>

  <p>Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor

  </ol>

  <h3>3. Distribution Obligations.</h3>

  <h4>3.1. Application of License.</h4>

  <p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
  by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The
  Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of
  this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1,
  and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
  You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
  version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
  recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
  offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.</p>

  <h4>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</h4>

  <p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
  available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the
  same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
  Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if
  made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available
  for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available,
  or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
  Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible
  for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
  Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</p>

  <h4>3.3. Description of Modifications.</h4>

  <p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
  documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of
  any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is
  derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
  Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source
  Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
  in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</p>

  <h4>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</h4>

  <h5>(a) Third Party Claims</h5>

  <p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
  intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by
  such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text
  file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which
  describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
  recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge
  after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
  Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
  makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
  appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those
  who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.</p>

  <h5>(b) Contributor APIs</h5>

  <p>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
  interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
  reasonably necessary to implement that <abbr>API</abbr>, Contributor must
  also include this information in the <span class="very-strong">Legal</span>
  file.</p>

  <h5>(c) Representations.</h5>

  <p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4
  (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
  Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
  to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>

  <h4>3.5. Required Notices.</h4>

  <p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
  Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code
  file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location
  (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such
  a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as
  a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate
  this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe
  recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may
  choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
  may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
  or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
  hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result
  of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>

  <h4>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</h4>

  <p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
  requirements of Sections  3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that
  Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
  version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
  including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
  of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
  Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
  Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of
  Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
  that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
  license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
  recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
  this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
  license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
  this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
  Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
  Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
  Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p>

  <h4>3.7. Larger Works.</h4>

  <p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
  not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
  single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
  License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>

  <h3>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</h3>

  <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
  judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
  this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations
  and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the
  <span class="very-strong">Legal</span> file described in Section 3.4 and must
  be included  with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent
  prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
  detailed for a  recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>

  <h3>5. Application of this License.</h3>

  <p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
  the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.</p>

  <h3>6. Versions of the License.</h3>

  <h4>6.1. New Versions</h4>

  <p>Netscape Communications Corporation (&quot;Netscape&quot;) may publish
  revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
  will be given a distinguishing version number.</p>

  <h4>6.2. Effect of New Versions</h4>

  <p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
  License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version.
  You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any
  subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than
  Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
  under this License.</p>

  <h4>6.3. Derivative Works</h4>

  <p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
  only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
  governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
  phrases &quot;Mozilla&quot;, &quot;MOZILLAPL&quot;, &quot;MOZPL&quot;,
  &quot;Netscape&quot;, &quot;MPL&quot;, &quot;NPL&quot; or any confusingly
  similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license
  differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version
  of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
  Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
  Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
  themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)</p>

  <h3>7. <strong class="very-strong">Disclaimer of warranty</strong></h3>

  <p><strong class="very-strong">Covered code is provided under this license
  on an &quot;as is&quot; basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed
  or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the covered code is
  free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
  non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
  covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any
  respect, you (not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the
  cost of any necessary servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of
  warranty constitutes an essential part of this license. No use of any covered
  code is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.</strong></p>

  <h3>8. Termination</h3>

  <p>8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
  breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
  Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
  License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
  termination of this License shall survive.</p>

  <p>8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
  (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
  Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
  action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
    any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
    Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
    Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt
    of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
    agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications
    made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with
    respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60
    days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
    mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is
    not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections
    2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day
    notice period specified above.</li>

    <li>any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
    Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
    rights  granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b)
    are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
    distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
  that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
  any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
  prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
  value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2
  shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment
  or license.</p>

  <p>8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end
  user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
  validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall
  survive termination.</p>

  <h3>9. <strong class="very-strong">Limitation of liability</strong></h3>

  <p><strong class="very-strong">Under no circumstances and under no legal
  theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall
  you, the initial developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of

  for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
  character including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work
  stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial

  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
  enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions

  losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court
  costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the

  <h3>License</h3>

  <p>This software, including documentation, source code, object code and/or
  additional materials (TGIFImage) is owned by Anders Melander (the Author).</p>

  <p>This License does not provide you with title or ownership of TGIFImage, but
  only a right of limited use as outlined in this License agreement. The Author
  hereby grants you a non-exclusive, royalty free license to use TGIFImage as
  set forth below:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>integrate TGIFImage with your Applications, subject to the
    redistribution terms below.</li>

    <li>modify or adapt TGIFImage in whole or in part for the development of
    Applications based on TGIFImage.</li>

    <li>use portions of the TGIFImage source code or TGIFImage Demo Programs in
    your own products.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Redistribution rights</h3>

  <p>You are granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free right to reproduce and
  redistribute executable files created using TGIFImage (the Executable Code)
  in conjunction with software products that you develop and/or market (the
  Applications).</p>

  <h4>Restrictions</h4>

  <p>Without the expressed, written consent of the Author, you may NOT:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>distribute modified versions of TGIFImage, in whole or in part.</li>

    <li>rent or lease TGIFImage.</li>

    <li>sell any portion of TGIFImage on its own, without integrating it into

  <h3>Limited warranty</h3>

  <p>There is no warranty or other guarantee of fitness for this software, it is
  provided solely &quot;as is&quot;. Bug reports or fixes may be sent to the
  Author, who may or may not act on them as he desires.</p>

  <h3>LZW license</h3>

  <p>GIF (and thus TGIFImage) uses an adaption of the LZW compression algorithm
  for image compression. The LZW algorithm is patented by UNISYS. Unfortunately
  UNISYS requires royalty payment for all software that uses the LZW
  algorithm.</p>

  <p>To avoid the use of the LZW algorithm for writing GIFs, TGIFImage can write
  GIFs using a LZW compatible RLE compression method. See the
  <var>TGIFImage.Compression</var> property for more information. There are
  conflicting opinions on whether a LZW license is required to read GIFs. Some
  patent lawyers are of the opinion that the LZW patent does not cover LZW
  decoders, but others disagree. If this matters to you, you should contact your
  own lawyer.</p>

  <p>For information regarding UNISYS' view on the use of LZW in commercial
  software, please read the License Information on GIF and Other LZW-based
  Technologies. The UNISYS patent on the LZW algorithm may or may not apply to
  you depending on the laws of your country. Personally I have less than warm
  feelings for Unisys and their patent and I don't care if you have a license or
  not.</p>

  <p>The LZW patent <span style="text-decoration:line-through">expires</span>
  expired in 2004.</p>

  <h3>Credit of work</h3>

  <p>If you redistribute TGIFImage in binary form (i.e. as a library or linked
  into an application), the accompanying documentation (e.g. readme file, help
  file or about-box) should state that This software is based, in part, on the
  work of Anders Melander or words to that effect.</p>

  <p><strong>1. Definitions</strong></p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li><strong>&quot;Adaptation&quot;</strong> means a work based upon the
    Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
    adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
    recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived
    from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not
    be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the
    avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
    phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
    image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the
    purpose of this License.</li>

    <li><strong>&quot;Collection&quot;</strong> means a collection of literary
    or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
    phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works
    listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which
    the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or
    more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
    in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work
    that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as
    defined below) for the purposes of this License.</li>

    <li><strong>&quot;Creative Commons Compatible License&quot;</strong> means a
    license that is listed at <a
      href="http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses"
    >http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses</a> that has been approved by
    Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including,
    at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same
    purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and,
    (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made
    available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons
    jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.</li>

    singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver,
    declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works
    or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
    being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance
    or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that
    transmits the broadcast.</li>

    <li><strong>&quot;Work&quot;</strong> means the literary and/or artistic
    work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation
    any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may
    be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a
    book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic
    work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without
    words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a
    process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
    architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to

    previous violation.</li>

    <li><strong>&quot;Publicly Perform&quot;</strong> means to perform public
    recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public
    recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means
    or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in

  <p><strong>2. Fair Dealing Rights.</strong> Nothing in this License is
  intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
  arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection
  with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable
  laws.</p>

  <p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of
  this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright)
  license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;</li>

    <li>to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
    label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
    original Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The original
    work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or a modification could
    indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;</li>

    <li>to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
    Collections; and,</li>

    <li>to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.</li>

    <li>
      For the avoidance of doubt:
      <ol type="i">
        <li><strong>Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes</strong>. In those
        jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
        statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License;</li>

        <li><strong>Waivable Compulsory License Schemes</strong>. In those
        jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
        statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor
        waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
        You of the rights granted under this License; and,</li>

        <li><strong>Voluntary License Schemes</strong>. The Licensor waives the
        right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
        the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You
        of the rights granted under this License.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
  known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
  modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
  media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
  by Licensor are hereby reserved.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong> The license granted in Section 3 above
  is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
    this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
    restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
    Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
    License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
    that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
    copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work
    from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
    the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
    Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work
    itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
    Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section
    4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
    credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.</li>

    <li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
    terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the
    same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
    license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
    License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));
    (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation
    under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms
    of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the
    licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the &quot;Applicable
    License&quot;), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License
    generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or
    the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms
    on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the
    ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to
    that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must
    keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the
    disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
    Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a
    recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
    require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject
    to the terms of the Applicable License.</li>

    <li>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
    4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
    Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
    Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&quot;Attribution
    Parties&quot;) in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
    reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
    Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
    does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
    Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an
    Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
    (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or
    &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The
    credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable
    manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection,
    at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
    contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the
    credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner
    set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
    implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
    endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
    appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
    prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.</li>

    <li>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
    action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original
    Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
    e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of
    this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
    distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial
    to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or
    not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
    the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
    under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
    otherwise.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p>

  <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
  OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
  CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
  WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
  DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
  DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

  <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED
  BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL
  THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
  HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

  <p><strong>7. Termination</strong></p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from
    You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
    provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
    licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
    License.</li>

    <li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong></p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
    and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.</li>

    <li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.</li>

    <li>If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</li>

    <li>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
    signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.</li>

    <li>This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
    written agreement of the Licensor and You.</li>

    <li>The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
    the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
    1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
    WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
    Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
    take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
    sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
    the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
    additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
    deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
    restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.</li>

  <p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
  COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENSE&quot;). THE WORK IS
  PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER
  THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.</p>

  <p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
  BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
  CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
  CONDITIONS.</p>

  <p><strong>1. Definitions</strong></p>

  <ol type="a">

    <li><strong>&quot;Collective Work&quot;</strong> means a work, such as a
    periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its
    entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
    constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled
    into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not
    be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this
    License.</li>

    <li><strong>&quot;Derivative Work&quot;</strong> means a work based upon the
    Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
    musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
    version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
    other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except
    that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
    Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt,
    where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the
    synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
    (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose
    of this License.</li>

    <li><strong>&quot;Licensor&quot;</strong> means the individual or entity
    that offers the Work under the terms of this License.</li>

    <li><strong>&quot;Original Author&quot;</strong> means the individual or
    entity who created the Work.</li>

    <li><strong>&quot;Work&quot;</strong> means the copyrightable work of
    authorship offered under the terms of this License.</li>

    <li><strong>&quot;You&quot;</strong> means an individual or entity
    exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the
    terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
    permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
    previous violation.</li>

  </ol>

  <p><strong>2. Fair Use Rights.</strong> Nothing in this license is intended
  to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
  other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
  copyright law or other applicable laws.</p>


  <p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of
  this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright)
  license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collective Works;</li>

    <li>to create and reproduce Derivative Works;</li>

    <li>to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
    publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the
    Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;</li>

    <li>to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
    publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
    Derivative Works.</li>

    <li>
      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical
      composition:
      <ol type="i">
        <li><strong>Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses</strong>.
        Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or
        via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for
        the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of
        the Work.</li>

        <li><strong>Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties</strong>. Licensor
        waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
        music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
        royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work (&quot;cover
        version&quot;) and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created
        by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
        other jurisdictions).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties</strong>. For the
    avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
    exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights
    society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance
    (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
    USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
    jurisdictions).</li>

  </ol>


  <p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
  known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
  modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
  media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
  reserved.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong> The license granted in Section 3 above is
  expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: </p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
    must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License
    with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
    publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
    any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
    the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not
    sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
    License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
    publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work
    with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
    manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
    require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to
    the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from
    any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective
    Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a
    Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
    clause 4(b), as requested.</li>

    <li>If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You
    must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
    Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the
    Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a
    sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's
    copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of
    such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent
    reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
    Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in
    the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
    the Derivative Work (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original
    Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original
    Author&quot;). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work,
    at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship
    credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
    comparable authorship credit.</li>

  </ol>
  <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p>

  <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
  OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
  CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
  WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
  DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
  DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

  <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED
  BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL
  THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
  HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </p>

  <p><strong>7. Termination</strong> </p>

  <ol type="a">

    <li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective
    Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance
    with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
    termination of this License.</li>

    <li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong> </p>

  <ol type="a">

    <li>Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
    Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
    on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.</li>

    <li>Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
    Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the
    same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.</li>

    <li>If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</li>

    <li>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
    signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.</li>

    <li>This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
