<h1>
  Legacy User Database Files
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  From CodeSnip version 2 to 4 the program stored its &quot;user defined&quot;
  database in an XML file along with a number of data files located in the
  user database directory. There was a different user database for each logged
  on user.
</p>

<p>
  This file format is retained to enable CodeSnip 5 to read databases created
  by CodeSnip 2 to 4. CodeSnip 5 can load its database from one of these legacy
  files, but but does not write files in this format.
</p>

<p>
  The master XML file is named <code>database.xml</code>. It contains all the
  information about user defined snippets and categories except for the source
  code of each snippet.
</p>

<p>
  The source code for each snippet is stored in separate sequentially numbered
  .dat data files &ndash; one per snippet. Each source code file is referenced
  by the XML file.
</p>

<p>
  There have been several different versions of the XML file format between
  CodeSnip 2 and CodeSnip 4. Each of the variations is explained below.
</p>

<p class="pullout">
  From CodeSnip 5 a new database format was introduced. This format is
  <a href="database.html">documented elsewhere</a>.
</p>

<h2>
  Encoding
</h2>

<p>
  CodeSnip 4 stored all user database files using UTF-8 encoding. Files were
  saved <em>without</em> any UTF-8 preamble (BOM). The XML processing
  instruction of <code>database.xml</code> had an &quot;encoding&quot; attribute
  set to &quot;UTF-8&quot;.
</p>

<p>
  Prior to CodeSnip v4 source code data files were encoded using the system
  default ANSI code page. The XML file was in UTF-8, but its XML processing
  instruction had no &quot;encoding&quot; attribute.
</p>

<p>
  CodeSnip v5 must be able to read files with all these encoding because it may
  inherit a copy of a user database in any of them.
</p>

<h2>
  File Format
</h2>

<h3>
  XML File
</h3>

<p>
  There were six different versions of the XML file formats &ndash; v1 to v6.
  Nodes from all six versions are explained below with notes describing which
  versions a node applies to. Where there is no note, the node is valid in all
  versions.
</p>

  <div class="reader-note">
    Notes about how the fields are used in CodeSnip 5 (and later) are displayed
    in boxes like this one.

<h3>
  Source Code Files
</h3>

<p>
  Source code is stored separately from the main XML file. The source code of
  each snippet has its file. Files are numbered sequentially and have a .dat
  extension, for example <code>6.dat</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Source code files are referenced by the
  <em>codesnip-data/routines/routine/source-code</em> node in the database's
  XML file.
