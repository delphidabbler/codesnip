<h1>
  Source Code Language Definition Files
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  CodeSnip uses this file format to record details of the source code languages
  it supports. The format is used for two slightly different purposes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <em>Predefined languages</em> &ndash; These are source code languages that
    CodeSnip knows about by default. The languages are recorded definition
    &quot;file&quot; that is included in the program resources.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>User-defined languages</em> &ndash; These are source code languages
    defined by the user. They are recorded in a physical file that is stored in
    CodeSnip's per-user application data directory.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
  Encoding
</h2>

<p>
  This is a simple plain text file format encoded as UTF-8 with byte order mark,
  regardless of how the data is stored.
</p>

<h2>
  File Format
</h2>

<p>
  The file is introduced by a header line followed by zero or more
  <em>Language</em> statements, each of which defines a single source code
  language.
</p>

<h3>
  Header Line
</h3>

<p>
  The header line must occupy the first line, with no preceding white space or
  comments. This line must be:
</p>

<pre class="indent">► CodeSnip Source Code Languages v1 ◄</pre>

<p class="pullout">
  <strong>NOTE:</strong>
  The ► and ◄ characters were chosen for the header line because they encode in
  a unique way in UTF-8 &ndash; ANSI files will not encode them correctly. This
  provides a second check for the correct file format in addition to the byte
  order mark.
</p>

<h3 id="language">
  Language Statements
</h3>

<p>
  The remainder of the file a sequence of <em>Language</em> statements,
  optionally interspersed with <a href="#comments">blank</a> and
  <a href="#comments">comment</a> lines.
</p>

<p>
  Each <em>Language</em> statement is introduced by the <code>Language</code>
  keyword as the first non <a href="#white-space">white space</a> token on a
  line.
</p>

<p>
  <code>Language</code> is immediately followed by white space then a unique
  language identifier. The identifier <strong>must</strong> start with a valid
  Unicode letter or digit and be followed by a sequence of zero or more Unicode
  letters, digits and punctuation characters. It <strong>must</strong> also be
  unique within the file in which it is defined. However an identifier in the
  user-defined theme file can be the same as one in the pre-defined
  &quot;file&quot;. In such a case the definition in the user-defined file
  updates the pre-defined value.
</p>

<p>
  Optionally a human-readable language name follows the language identifier and
  is separated from it by white space. The human-readable name continues up to
  the end of the line, and may contain white space. If the human-readable name
  is omitted then the language identifier is also used as the human readable
  name.
</p>

<p>
  Examples:
</p>

<div class="indent">

  <p>
    <code>Language CPP C Plus Plus</code>
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    introduces a language with identifier <code>CPP</code> and with human
    readable name <code>C Plus Plus</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>Language HTML</code>
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    introduces a language with identifier <code>HTML</code> and with the human
    readable name also set to <code>HTML</code>.
  </p>

</div>

<p>
  Following the <code>Language</code> line comes a sequence of other optional
  statements that provide additional information about the language. They are,
  in any order:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#tab-size"><em>Tab Size</em></a> statement.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#brush"><em>Brush</em></a> statement.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  A <em>Language</em> statement is terminated by the next <code>Language</code>
  keyword or by the end of the file.
</p>

<h3 id="tab-size">
  Tab Size Statement
</h3>

<p>
  This statement always occurs as part of a
  <a href="#language"><em>Language</em></a> statement. It defines the size of
  a tab used when editing code in the related language. The tab size is
  specified as a number of spaces.
</p>

<p>
  The statement is introduced by the <code>TabSize</code> keyword, which must be
  the first non <a href="#white-space">white space</a> token on the line.
  <code>TabSize</code> is followed by white space and then the required tab size
  as a base 10 integer in the range 1 to 255. The statement is closed at the end
  of the line.
</p>

<p>
  The <em>Tab Size</em> statement may be omitted, in which case the language is
  given a default tab size of 4 spaces.
</p>

<p>
  A maximum of one <em>Tab Size</em> statement is required in each
  <a href="#language"><em>Language</em></a> statement. If the statement is
  duplicated the tab size is taken from the last occurrence.
</p>

<p>
  Example:
</p>

<p class="indent">
  <code>TabSize 2</code>
</p>

<h3 id="brush">
  Brush Statement
</h3>

<p>
  This statement always occurs as part of a
  <a href="#language"><em>Language</em></a> statement. It specifies the
  identifier of the &quot;brush&quot; used to syntax highlight code in the
  language.
</p>

<p>
  The statement is introduced by the <code>Brush</code> keyword which must be
  the first non <a href="#white-space">white space</a> token on the line.
  The keyword is followed by the required brush identifier. This
  <strong>must</strong> be either &quot;<code>&lt;Unknown&gt;</code>&quot; or be
  made up of one or more of the following characters:
  '<code>A</code>'..'<code>Z</code>', '<code>a</code>'..'<code>z</code>',
  '<code>0</code>'..'<code>9</code>', '<code>-</code>' or '<code>_</code>'. It
  <em>should</em> identify a brush that is supported by CodeSnip.
</p>

<p>
  If the <em>Brush</em> statement is omitted the <em>null</em> brush is assumed.
  This has identifier &quot;<code>_Null_</code>&quot;.
</p>

<p>
  A maximum of one <em>Brush</em> statement is required in each
  <a href="#language"><em>Language</em></a> statement. If the statement is
  duplicated the brush identifier is taken from the last occurrence.
</p>

<h3 id="comments">
  Comments
</h3>

<p>
  Comments can be included on any line of the file <strong>after</strong> the
  header line. Comments occupy a line by themselves and a introduced by a
  &quot;<code>#</code>&quot; (hash) character as the first non white space on a
  line.
</p>

<p>
  Comment lines are ignored and are stripped from the file before parsing.
</p>

<p>
  Note that comments cannot be placed on the same line as a command.
</p>

<h3 id="white-space">
  White Space, End-Of-Line &amp; Blank Lines
</h3>

<p>
  The End-of-line characters, <em>CR</em> and <em>LF</em> are used to terminate
  command lines.
</p>

<p>
  Leading and trailing white space is ignored: it is always stripped off before
  parsing begins. This means that white space can be used to indent commands to
  make their relationship to one another more apparent.
</p>

<p>
  Blank lines can be inserted anywhere in the language definition file after the
  header line and are ignored. They are stripped out before processing the
  file contents.
</p>

<h3 id="full-example">
  Example user-defined file
</h3>

<p>
  Here is an example of a user-defined source code language definition file.
</p>
