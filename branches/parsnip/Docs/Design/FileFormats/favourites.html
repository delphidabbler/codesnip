<h1>
  Favourites Files
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  CodeSnip uses this file format when it saves the current user's favourite
  snippets to disk. The files use a custom format.
</p>

<h2>
  Encoding
</h2>

<p>
  This is a simple plain text file format encoded as UTF-8 with byte order mark.
</p>

<h2>
  File Format
</h2>

<p>
  The file is introduced by a header line, which must occupy the first line.
  This line must be:
</p>

<pre class="indent">► CodeSnip Favourites v1 ◄</pre>

<p>
  Immediately following the header line comes a list of information about the
  user's favourite snippets. Information about each favourite occupies a single
  line. The information comprises three fields, separated by TAB characters. The
  fields are:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Snippet name as a UTF-8 string.
  </li>
  <li>
    A flag indicating whether the snippet is user defined or not. The text
    &quot;True&quot; indicates a user defined snippet and &quot;False&quot;
    signifies a snippet from the main database.
  </li>
  <li>
    The date and time the snippet was last accessed. The date information is
    formatted according to the current locale.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Lines are separated by a CR / LF pair.
</p>

<p>
  If there are no favourites then the file contains only the header line.
</p>

<p>
  Blank lines are permitted anywhere except before the header line. Such lines
  are ignored.
</p>

<p class="pullout">
  <strong>NOTE:</strong>
  The ► and ◄ characters were chosen for the header line because they encode in
  a unique way in UTF-8 &ndash; ANSI files will not encode them correctly. This
  provides a second check for the correct file format in addition to the byte
  order mark.
