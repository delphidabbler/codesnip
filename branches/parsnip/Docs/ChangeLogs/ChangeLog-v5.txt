  - Print dialogue box now displays a preview of selected document formatting options.
  - Select Snippets dialogue box modified re change from two to one logical databases.
  - "Printing" tab removed from Preferences dialogue box. The button in the Print dialogue box that displayed this tab was removed.

  - New dialogue box to enable user to customise and create syntax highlighter themes. This dialogue box is accessed via the "Syntax Highlighter" tab of the Preferences dialogue box.
  - Snippet editor enlarged and controls changed re revised snippet properties.
+ Database changes:
  - Online Code Snippets Database is no longer treated differently to user database: all snippets are now editable.
  - Changed location of (user) database in portable mode and default location in standard mode. All database files are now per-user.
  - Snippet IDs (formerly "names") are now generated automatically instead of being provided by the user. The IDs can no longer be edited. This means that a snippet's ID can never be changed.
  - Snippet titles (formerly "display names") are now required since ID is no longer suitable as a default display name. Snippet titles are now used in the UI in places where the snippet name used to be used.
  - Splash screen can be hidden by passing the new -no-splash switch on CodeSnip's command line.
+ Support for snippets in languages other than Pascal has been added. Available languages are: Pascal, plain text *** GROW THIS LANGUAGE LIST AS NEW LANGUAGES ADDED ***
+ The user can now specify an external diff viewer to be used by CodeSnip. *** Update this line when diff viewer is actually used for something!! ***
+ Syntax highlighter changes:
  - Syntax highlighting is now available for all supported programming languages.
  - Different highlighter "themes" can now be used for user interface, exported code and printed output.
  - User designed themes are now saved in a themes file alongside the per-user config file, instead of in the config file.
+ Portable application changes:
  - CodeSnip no acts in portable mode when -portable switch is passed on command line. There is no longer a separate build for the portable version.
  - New launcher application that starts CodeSnip in portable mode.
+ Common and per-user configuration file names and locations changed for both standard and portable modes. Per-user configuration file format changed and version bumped to v16.
+ Changes to "first run" detection and configuration code:
  - Modified to detect v5 installs and to treat v4 installs as legacy.
  - Fixed bug where databases moved by user were not being detected.
