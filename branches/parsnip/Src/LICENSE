This file describes the licenses that apply to source code files in the Src
directory and its sub-directories, unless the sub-directory or its closest
parent directory also contains a LICENSE file, in which case that file takes
precedence.

Most files contain a comment that provides license information.

Exceptions are:

* All .dfm files are licensed under the same license as the related .pas file.
  For example, if Foo.pas is licensed under the Mozilla Public License v2.0 then
  the same license also applies to Foo.dfm.

* The following files have any copyright dedicated to the Public Domain
