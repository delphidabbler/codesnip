      SWAG Import Wizard
    </h1>
    <p>
      This wizard is used to enable you import snippets from the
      <a href="about_swag.htm">SWAG Database</a> into your code snippets
      database. The wizard is accessed from the <em>Snippets | Import
      Snippets From SWAG</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <h2>
      First page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page simply gives an overview of how to use the wizard. Click the
      <em>Next</em> button to display the <em>Select required snippets</em>
      page.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;Select required snippets&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      When this page is first displayed it downloads information about the
      available categories from the SWAG database. A list of categories is then
      displayed in the left hand, <em>SWAG categories</em>, list box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose a category in the list and click the <em>Show Snippets In
      Category</em> button to display a list of its snippets in the right
      hand list box. The first time you choose a category the wizard will
      download the snippet list from the SWAG database. Note that
      double-clicking a category has the same effect as clicking the <em>Show
      Snippets In Category</em> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select any snippets you want to import by ticking the check box next to
      the snippet's name. If you want to preview the snippet before deciding
      whether to import it highlight the snippet and click the <em>Preview
      Selected Snippet</em> button. The snippet will then be downloaded (if
      necessary) and displayed in a dialogue box. Note that double-clicking a
      snippet has the same effect as clicking the <em>Preview Selected
      Snippet</em> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeat this process for further categories if you wish. When you are
      ready to import your chosen snippets click the <em>Next</em> button to
      display the <em>Ready to import</em> page.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;Ready to import&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page lists all the snippets you have selected for import along with
      the unique ID (i.e. snippet name) that will be assigned to it after
      import. Note that snippets may be downloaded from the SWAG database when
      the page is displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should review your selection. If you want to make any changes use the
      <em>Back</em> button to go back <em>Select required snippets</em> page.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are ready to import click the <em>Import</em> button. Once
      <em>Import</em> has been clicked the wizard will perform the import. A
      dialogue box will be displayed while the import proceeds. When the import
      has finished the <em>Import complete</em> page.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Import complete
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page simply confirms the import has completed. You should note that
      the snippets will have been imported into a special category named
      &quot;SWAG Imports&quot; by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the <em>Finish</em> to close the wizard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imported snippets are fully editable like any other user defined
      snippet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> <em>CodeSnip</em> does not track snippets imported
      from SWAG, so if you import same snippet more than once it will be
      duplicated in your local database &ndash; it will not overwrite the
      original.
