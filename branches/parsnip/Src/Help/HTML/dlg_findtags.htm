      Find Tags Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box enables snippets to be searched for by one or more tags.
      It is accessed from the <em>Search | Find Tags</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose the tags you wish to search for by ticking those required in the
      check list box. At least one tag must be ticked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now choose whether to search for snippets that have all the specified tags
      or to search for snippets that have any of the tags. Do this by selecting
      the relevant radio button in the <em>Search logic</em> group box.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may apply the search across the whole database or, if you have run
      another search, searching only the snippets selected by the previous
      search, and so refining that search. The <em>Search scope</em> group box
      is used to decide which course of action to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose to search the whole database any previous search is
      abandoned before this search is run. This means that if no snippets are
      found matching your search criteria, the previous search is lost and the
      whole database will be selected. On the other hand if you choose to refine
      the previous search and this search fails to find any snippets, the
      earlier search remains unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Search scope</em> group box is disabled if there was no existing
      search when this dialogue box was opened, and the search operates on the
      entire database.
