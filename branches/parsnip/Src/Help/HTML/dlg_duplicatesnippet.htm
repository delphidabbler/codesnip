    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is used to duplicate the currently selected snippet,
      creating a new user defined snippet. The dialogue box is accessed from the
      <em>Snippet | Duplicate Snippet</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter a title for the duplicated snippet in the <em>Title</em> edit
      control. The current snippet's title will be displayed in the control.
      You <strong>may</strong> use the same title for the duplicated snippet but
      it is best to change it to make it easier to distinguish between different
      snippets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newly duplicated snippet can be edited in the <a
        href="dlg_editsnippet.htm"
      >Snippets Editor</a> immediately after clicking the <em>OK</em> button. To
      do this tick the <em>Edit in Snippets Editor</em> check box. If you don't
      want to display the <em>Snippets Editor</em> leave the check box clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>OK</em> to create the duplicate snippet or click <em>Cancel</em>
      to abandon the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Upon clicking <em>OK</em> the duplicated snippet is
      added to the database immediately. If you have chosen to open the
      <em>Snippet Editor</em> automatically, this is done <strong>after</strong>
      the snippet has been added to the database. Therefore cancelling the
      <em>Snippets Editor</em> will <strong>not</strong> remove the duplicated
      snippet from the database: it merely cancels any changes you made in the
      editor. To remove the snippet select it and choose the <em>Snippet |
      Delete Snippet</em> menu option or press
      <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+Del</span>.
