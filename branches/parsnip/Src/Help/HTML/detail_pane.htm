    <h2>
      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      This pane appears on the right hand side of the display and shows
      detailed information about the currently selected snippet or section
      heading, along with some other information (see below).
    </p>
    <h2>
      Tabs
    </h2>
    <p>
      Information is be displayed in one or more tabs. Items selected in the
      <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview pane</a> are normally displayed in
      the currently selected tab, overwriting previous contents. This behaviour
      can be changed as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl</span> clicking items in the <a
          href="overview_pane.htm"
        >Overview pane</a> causes them to be displayed in a new tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pressing <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+T</span>, or choosing the <em>View
        | New Tab</em> menu option opens a new empty tab ready to display the
        next item chosen in the <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview pane</a>,
        for example.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl</span> clicking snippet and category links
        in the detail pane displays them in a new tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Newly created snippets and categories may be displayed in new tabs.
        This happens only if the feature is selected in the <a
          href="dlg_prefs_display.htm"
        >Display</a> tab of the <a
          href="dlg_preferences.htm"
        >Preferences</a> dialogue box.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When more than one tab is displayed you can quickly cycle through them
      from left to right by pressing <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+Tab</span> or
      from right to left using <span class="smallcaps">Shift+Ctrl+Tab</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can close tabs in one of three ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Close the selected tab using <em>Close Tab</em> menu option displayed on
        the <a href="menu_view.htm">View</a> menu, the detail pane's context
        menu and any tab's context menu. Alternatively press
        <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+F4</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close all except the selected tab by right clicking the tab and
        selecting the <em>Close All Other Tabs</em> option from the tab's
        context menu. Pressing <span class="smallcaps">Shift+Ctrl+F4</span> has
        the same effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close all open tabs using the <em><a href="menu_view.htm">View</a> |
        Close All Tabs</em> menu option.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some other types of information are always displayed in new tabs. See
      below for details.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Views
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are various types of item that can be displayed in a details pane
      tab. These are referred to as &quot;Views&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every view has a context menu displayed by right clicking or by pressing
      <span class="smallcaps">Alt+F10</span>. The content of this menu various
      according to the view or the selected element within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each type of view is described below.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Snippet View
    </h3>
    <p>
      The snippet view displays detailed information about a snippet. The
      display can be customised and may include the following components:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The snippet's name. This component is always present and its placing is
        fixed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          For snippets downloaded from the <em>Code Snippets Database</em> an
          image is displayed at the right hand end of the line containing the
          snippet name that gives information about the level of testing applied
          to the snippet. The images are:
        </div>
        <ul style="list-style: none;" class="unspaced">
          <li>
            <img
              src="..\Images\TestingBasic.png"
              class="glyph"
            >&nbsp;&nbsp;the snippet has been given some basic testing before
            uploading to the database.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="..\Images\TestingAdvanced.png"
              class="glyph"
            >&nbsp;&nbsp;the snippet has been more rigorously tested, for
            example by unit testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="..\Images\TestingNone.png"
              class="glyph"
            >&nbsp;&nbsp;the snippet has not been tested and should be used with
            care.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          This information is not displayed for user-defined snippets. In the
          place of the images is a link that can be clicked to edit the snippet.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        A brief description of the snippet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional information about the snippet, if present.
      </li>
      <li>
        The snippet's source code (syntax highlighted).
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a
          href="snippet_kinds.htm"
        >kind</a> of snippet this is.
      </li>
      <li>
        The category to which the snippet belongs. This forms a link to the
        category's contents.
      </li>
      <li>
        A list of standard Delphi units required by the snippet. <em>Not
        displayed by default for <a
          href="snippet_unit.htm"
        >unit</a> snippets.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        A list of other snippets called by the selected snippet. This list
        contains links to the snippets. <em>Not displayed by default for <a
          href="snippet_unit.htm"
        >unit</a> snippets.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        A cross reference to other similar snippets, labelled &quot;See
        also&quot;. Again, this list contains links to the snippets.
      </li>
      <li>
        A table indicating which compilers the snippet is compatible with. The
        compilers whose results are displayed in this table can be changed using
        the <a
          href="dlg_configcompilers.htm"
        >Configure Compilers</a> dialogue box. <em>Not displayed by default for
        <a
          href="snippet_freeform.htm"
        >free-form</a> snippets.</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The components present in a snippet view are specific to the <a
        href="snippet_kinds.htm"
      >snippet kind</a>. The program's default settings for these views can be
      customised using the <a
        href="dlg_prefs_snippetlayout.htm"
      >Snippet Layout</a> tab of the <a
        href="dlg_preferences.htm"
      >Preferences</a> dialogue box.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Section Contents View
    </h3>
    <p>
      Selecting a section header (a category, an initial letter or a <a
        href="snippet_kinds.htm"
      >snippet kind</a> in the <a
        href="overview_pane.htm"
      >Overview Pane</a> causes a table to be displayed in the detail pane that
      lists the name of the snippets contained in the section, along with their
      descriptions. Following a search, the listed snippets are just those
      contained in the current database selection, if any.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snippet names are links that, when clicked, displays the chosen snippet
      in the detail pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the section contains no snippets, a message to that effect is displayed
      instead of a table of contents.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Welcome Page View
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Welcome Page is displayed when the program starts and may also be
      re-displayed at any time from the <em>View | Welcome Page</em> menu item.
      This view is always displayed in a new tab.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Database Update View
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the database has been updated, all open tabs are closed and a new tab
      created that simply informs that the database has been updated
      successfully.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Empty Tab View
    </h3>
    <p>
      When a new tab is created (<em>View | New Tab</em> or <span
        class="smallcaps"
      >Ctrl+T</span>, nothing is displayed except &quot;Empty Tab&quot; in light
      grey.
    </p>
    <h2>
      View History
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whenever a snippet or section contents view is displayed, it is added to
      the view history list. You can return to the immediately preceding view by
      clicking the <img
        alt="Previous button"
        src="../Images/GoBack.png"
        class="glyph"
      ><em>Previous</em> toolbar button or by pressing <span
        class="smallcaps"
      >Alt+Left</span>. Once you have gone back in the history list you can go
      forward once again using the <img
        alt="Next button"
        src="../Images/GoForward.png"
        class="glyph"
      ><em>Next</em> toolbar button or by pressing <span
        class="smallcaps"
      >Alt+Right</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also jump directly to some recent views by selecting its name from
      the drop-down menus adjacent to the <img
        alt="Previous button"
        src="../Images/GoBack.png"
        class="glyph"
      ><em>Previous</em> and <img
        alt="Next button"
        src="../Images/GoForward.png"
        class="glyph"
      ><em>Next</em> buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deleting or editing an existing snippet or category will clear the
      history.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Snippet and Category Links
    </h2>
    <p>
      Links to snippets or categories may be displayed as part of snippet or
      section contents views.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking a snippet link displays a snippet view for that snippet in the
      current tab of the details pane, Clicking a category link causes a
      section contents view to be displayed for the contents of the category,
      again in the current tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Views displayed in this way are added to the history list.
