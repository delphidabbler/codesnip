    <h1>
      Mark-up Editor
    </h1>
    <p>
      The mark-up editor is used in the <a href="dlg_editsnippet.htm">Edit
      Snippet</a> dialogue box to enter text that can optionally be formatted.
      It is used to enter and edit snippet descriptions and notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor has two modes of operation: <em><a href="#plain-text">Plain
      Text</a></em> and <em><a href="#markup">Mark-up</a></em>. The modes are
      selected by using the buttons below the edit control. Each mode causes
      the text entered in the edit control to be interpreted in a different way,
      as explained below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Switching between the modes of operation does not change the text: it is
      simply interpreted differently. However, you can convert text between the
      two types as is explained in the <a href="#conversions">Conversions</a>
      section.
    </p>
    <h2 id="plain-text">
      Plain text
    </h2>
    <p>
      Selecting the <em>Plain Text</em> button causes the text entered in the
      edit control to be interpreted as plain text.
    </p>
    <p>
      All characters you enter are treated literally. You cannot style the text.
      Any URLs you enter are treated as plain text and are not interpreted as
      hyperlinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can enter multiple paragraphs of text by separating each paragraph
      with a blank line. Any text on consecutive lines is otherwise treated as
      a single line. For example:
    </p>
    <p class="indent bordered">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet<br>
      consectetur adipiscing elit.
    </p>
    <p>
      is interpreted as:
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit.
    </p>
    <p>
      but
    </p>
    <p class="indent bordered">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet<br><br>
      consectetur adipiscing elit.
    </p>
    <p>
      yields:
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      consectetur adipiscing elit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visual feedback that you are editing plain text comes from the fact the
      text is displayed in the default proportional font.
    </p>
    <h2 id="markup">
      Mark-up
    </h2>
    <p>
      Choosing the <em>Markup</em> tab causes the entered text to be treated as
      mark-up language, which is a very simple, HTML-like, language that allows
      for a limited amount of text formatting and for the inclusion of
      hyperlinks. For full details see the <a href="reml.htm">REML</a> help
      topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fixed width font is used to indicate you are editing
      <a href="reml.htm">REML</a> source code instead of plain text.
    </p>
    <h2 id="conversions">
      Conversions
    </h2>
    <p>
      Normally, if you switch between <em>Plain Text</em> and <em>Mark-up</em>
      modes, the text in the edit control does not change. However you can
      convert plain text into the equivalent <a href="reml.htm">REML</a> mark-up
      and vice versa. This is done from the mark-up editor's pop-up context
      menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two menu options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Convert To Plain Text</em>
        </div>
        <div>
          This option is only available when the editor is in <em>Mark-up</em>
          mode. It replaces the <a href="reml.htm">REML</a> mark-up in the edit
          control with the plain text equivalent.
        </div>
        <div>
          All in-line styling and hyperlinks are lost. Paragraphs and headings
          are converted to plain text paragraphs, separated by blank lines.
        </div>
        <div>
          The editor is switched into <em>Plain Text</em> mode.
        </div>
        <div>
          If there is an error in the mark-up an error message will be
          displayed, no conversion will take place and the mode will not be
          changed.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <em>Convert To Markup</em>
        </div>
        <div>
          This option is only available when the editor is in <em>Plain
          Text</em> mode. It replaces the text entered in the edit control with
          the equivalent <a href="reml.htm">REML</a> code.
        </div>
        <div>
          Illegal <a href="reml.htm">REML</a> characters are converted to
          character attributes. Paragraphs (i.e. blocks of text separated by
          blanks lines) are converted to <a href="reml.htm">REML</a> paragraphs
          using the &lt;p&gt; tag.
        </div>
        <div>
          The editor is switched into <em>Mark-up</em> mode.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
