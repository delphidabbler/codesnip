          Saves the source code of the currently selected routine or category
          to a file. The file is a fragment of Pascal code. The
          <a href="dlg_savesnippet.htm">Save Snippet</a> dialogue box is
          displayed and is used to determine the format of the file being saved.
          This can be plain text, a Pascal include file, HTML or RTF. The latter
          two options can be syntax highlighted. Not available for type
          definition and constant snippets.

          displayed where the required file name is entered. Note that this
          menu option is not available if there is not a current search, i.e. if
          the whole database is selected.
