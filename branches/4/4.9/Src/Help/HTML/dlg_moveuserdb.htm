      Move User Database Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p class="bordered">
      <strong>Note:</strong> This dialogue box is not available in the portable
      edition of <em>CodeSnip</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this dialogue box is to enable the user to move the user
      defined snippets database from its default location to a new directory.
      You may wish to do this to enable the database to be easily backed up.
      For example you could move the database to a sub-directory of a
      <em>Dropbox</em> or <em>GoogleDrive</em> directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have the option to restore a previously moved database to its default
      location. Both options are described below.
    </p>
    <p class="bordered">
      <strong>Important:</strong> You a strongly advised to make a backup of the
      user defined snippets database before moving it so that it can be easily
      restored if there is a problem. Use the <em>Database | Backup User
      Database</em> menu option to do this.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Move the database to a new directory
    </h2>
    <p>
      To move the database enter the <strong>full path</strong> of the new
      directory in the edit box. Instead of typing the path you can choose it
      from a standard <em>Browse For Folder</em> dialogue box by clicking the
      ellipsis button to the right of the edit control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The directory where the database must meet the following conditions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the directory must be empty;
      </li>
      <li>
        it must not be a sub-directory of the current database location;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once a suitable path has been entered, click the large <em>Move</em>
      button. You will be prompted to confirm this action and then the database
      files will be copied &ndash; a progress bar will be displayed to indicate
      how long the process will take. An error message will be displayed if the
      database can't be copied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new location of the database will be recorded in the per user config
      file and it is important that this file is not modified or deleted
      otherwise the database will not be found.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Restore database to default directory
    </h2>
    <p>
      The database can be moved back to its default directory simply by clicking
      the <em>Restore Default Path</em> button. If the default directory is not
      empty this action will fail and an error message will be displayed. As
      above, a progress bar gives an indication of how long the process may
      take.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Restore Default Path</em> button will be disabled if database is
      already in its default location.
    </p>
