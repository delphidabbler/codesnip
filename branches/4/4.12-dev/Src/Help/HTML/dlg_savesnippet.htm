    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is displayed when the <em>File | Save Annotated
      Source</em> menu option is clicked. It is used to specify the required
      file name, type and formatting information for the
      <a href="snippet_routine.htm">routine</a> snippet or category that is to
      be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The saved code includes comments noting the units and any other snippets
      from the database that are required by the saved routine(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      The output file contains the source code of the currently selected
      <a href="snippet_routine.htm">routine</a> snippet or category. If a
      category is selected its contained routines are included in the output
      file, but any non-routine snippets are ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue is a standard Windows save dialogue box with a few added
      options.
    </p>
    <p>
      You specify the name and folder for the file in the usual way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the <em>Save as type</em> drop down list to specify the type of file
      to be saved. Options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A Pascal include file (.inc) - The code is written to a file with
        extension *.inc that can be included in any Pascal source file.
      </li>
      <li>
        A plain text file (.txt) - This is the same as the Pascal include file
        except that the extension is .txt rather than .inc.
      </li>
      <li>
        An HTML file (.html) - This option writes the source code out as a
        valid XHTML document that uses CSS to format the code. The document can
        be syntax highlighted if the <em>Use syntax highlighting</em>
        check box is checked.
      </li>
      <li>
        A rich text file (.rtf) - The source code is written out as an RTF
        document. Again syntax highlighting can be used if the <em>Use syntax
        highlighting</em> check box is checked.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Snippet descriptions can be written as a Pascal comment to the output
      file. Use the <em>Comment style</em> drop down list to specify the style
      of commenting to be used. Comments can be inhibited using by selecting the
      <em>No comments</em> option from the list. If the <em>Truncate comments to
      1st paragraph</em> check box is ticked then only the first paragraph of
      the snippet's description is used. Clearing this check box means that all
      of the description is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output can be previewed by clicking the <em>Preview</em> button. This
      displays the source code in a dialogue box, formatted according to your
      selections. Text in the preview can be selected and copied to the
      clipboard if required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the <em>Save</em> button to write the file to disk or press
      <em>Cancel</em> to abort.
    </p>
