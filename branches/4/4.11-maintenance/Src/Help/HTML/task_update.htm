    <p>
      Updates to the code snippets database are made available from time to time
      on the web. You can download the latest version of the database easily by
      connecting to the internet then clicking the <img
        src="../Images/Download.png"
        class="glyph"
        alt="Update Database button"
      > <em>Update Database from Web</em> toolbar button or by choosing the
      <em>Database | Update From Web</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a
        href="dlg_update.htm"
      >Update From Web</a> dialogue box will be displayed. Make sure you are
      connected to the internet then click the <em>Update from Web</em> button
      to begin the update.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default <em>CodeSnip</em> checks periodically to find if any database
      updates are available. It displays a pop-up notification in the main
      window if an update is available. The notification includes a button that
      displays the <a
        href="dlg_update.htm"
      >Update From Web</a> dialogue box mentioned above. You can switch this
      feature off, or change the frequency with which checks are made, by using
      the <a
        href="dlg_prefs_updates.htm"
      >Updates</a> tab of the <a
        href="dlg_preferences.htm"
      >Preferences</a> dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Database updates apply to all users. This is because only one copy of the
      database exists on the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Updating the database has no effect on any user-defined snippets that have
      been created &ndash; they are not overwritten by the update process.
