      Find Compiler Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box enables snippets to be searched for by their relationship
      with various compilers. The dialog is accessed from the <em>Search |
      Compiler</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialog works by applying a search criteria to any or all of a
      selection of compilers. Choose the criteria you wish to search on in the
      <em>Criteria</em> drop down list. The possible criteria are:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        <em>Compiles</em> - finds snippets that compile OK, with or without
        warnings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Compiles with no warnings</em> - finds snippets that compile
        without warnings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Compiles with warnings</em> - finds snippets that compile with
        warnings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Does not compile</em> - finds snippets that do not compile.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Not tested</em> - finds snippets that have not been tested.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Having selected the criteria, choose the compilers you need to test
      against by ticking those required in the <em>Compilers</em> check list.
      Use the <em>Select All</em> and <em>Clear All</em> buttons to set or
      clear all check marks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally choose whether to search for snippets that match the criteria for
      any or all compilers. Do this by selecting the required radio button in
      the <em>Search logic</em> group box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that you must select at least one compiler.
