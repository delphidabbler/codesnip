    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box is displayed when the <em>File | Save Snippet</em> menu
      option is clicked. It is used to specify the file name, file type and
      formatting information for the source code snippet that is to be
      saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The source saved is that of the currently selected routine or
      category. If a category is selected, all its contained routines are
      included in the code snippet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialog is a standard Windows save dialog box with a few added
      options.
    </p>
    <p>
      You specify the name and folder for the file that the code snippet will
      be saved in in the usual way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the <em>Save as type</em> drop down list to specify the type of file
      to be saved. Options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A Pascal include file (.inc) - The code is written to a file with
        extension *.inc that can be included in any Pascal source file. The
        code includes comments noting the units and any other routines from the
        database that are required by the saved routine(s).
      </li>
      <li>
        A plain text file (.txt) - This is the same as the Pascal include file
        except that the extension is .txt rather than .inc.
      </li>
      <li>
        An HTML file (.html) - This option writes the source code out as a
        valid XHTML document that uses CSS to format the code. The document can
        contain syntax highlighting if the <em>Use syntax highlighting</em>
        check box is checked.
      </li>
      <li>
        A rich text file (.rtf) - The source code is written out as an RTF
        document. Again syntax highlighting can be used if the <em>Use syntax
        highlighting</em> check box is checked.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The routines in the output file can be documented with their associated
      descriptions placed in Pascal comments. Use the <em>Comment style</em>
      drop down list to specify the style of commenting to be used. Select <em>
      No comments</em> to omit the descriptive comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output can be previewed by clicking the <em>Preview</em> button. This
      displays the source code in a dialog box, formatted according to your
      selections. Text in the preview can be selected and copied to the
      clipboard if required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the <em>Save</em> button to write the source code to disk or <em>
      Cancel</em> to abort.
    </p>
  </body>
