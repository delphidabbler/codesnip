    <h1>
      Overview Pane
    </h1>
    <p>
      This pane appears on the left hand side of the main window. It lists all
      the snippets in the database. Snippets can be grouped in three ways:
      by category, using the <em>Categorised</em> tab, alphabetically, using the
      <em>Alphabetical</em> tab or by <a href="snippet_kinds.htm">snippet
      kind</a> using the <em>Snippet Kind</em> tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selecting an item in the overview pane causes detailed information about
      it to appear in the <a href="detail_pane.htm">Detail Pane</a>. Selecting a
      snippet displays a description and its source code while selecting a
      section heading lists all the currently selected routines in the section
      along with their descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nodes of the tree used to display the routines can be expanded and
      collapsed using the
      <img
        src="../images/expand.gif"
        alt="Expand toolbar button"
        class="glyph"
      > or
      <img
        src="../images/collapse.gif"
        alt="Collapse toolbar button"
        class="glyph"
      >  buttons in the title of the pane, or by using the various expand and
      collapse options on the <a href="menu_view.htm">View</a> menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can confgure how the overview pane's display appears when the program
      starts by using the <a
        href="dlg_prefs_general.htm"
      >General</a> tab of the <a
        href="dlg_preferences.htm"
      >Preferences</a> dialog box (accessed via the <em>Tools | Preferences</em>
      menu option). The pane can either display all items or just the section
      headers.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Keyboard Shortcuts
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following keyboard shortcuts can be used when the overview pane has
      focus.
