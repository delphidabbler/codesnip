    <p>
      A constant snippet defines one or more Pascal constants. They can either
      be true constants or typed constants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each constant snippet begins with the <strong>const</strong> keyword as
      the first non-space text in the source code. Comments may not preceed it.
      The <strong>const</strong> keyword is followed by at least one space or
      newline and then one or more constant definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an example of a valid constant snippet:
    </p>
<pre class="source-code">const
  cRangeMax = 3;
  cRangeMin = 1;
  cIntArray: array[cRangeMin..cRangeMax] of Integer = (42, 56, 99);</pre>
    <p>
      Constant snippets may refer to other 
      <a href="snippet_type.htm">type definitions</a> or constants, providing
      they are defined in Delphi units or elsewhere in the database. The
      snippet's units and dependencies references should indicate where to
      find the other types and constants. Constants may not reference
      <a href="snippet_routine.htm">routines</a> or 
      <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">freeform</a> snippets.
    </p>
  </body>
