other documentation, including writing the release 4 change log.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Development started 26 Nov 2010.

* Version numbers set to 3.99.0.0 - will bump third number by one for each
  released alpha or beta version and fourth number will be set to an appropriate
  build number at the time of release.

* Periodic merging of changes from v3 development tree (trunk). Some trunk
  changes ignored where they clash with v4 changes.

Changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Features
  o Can now specify search paths for compiler to use to find 3rd party and user
    units.
  o Now use wizard for code imports.

* Added a "Tests" directory and project for unit tests.
  o Tests for UStrUtils
  o Tests for UUtils (some changes to pass tests)

* Refactorings and similar:
  o View unit - complete rewrite
  o Snippet Kind Info and Initial Letter code - complete rewrite
  o Alpha grouping code
  o Initial letter object changes.
  o TDOSDateTime class.
  o Original installer Pascal Script files.
  o Code that manages saving of source code files.
  o Renamed various unit, class, field and other names that referred to Snippets
    as "routines".
  o Some streamlining of units, removing / refactoring out some code.
  o Rationalised HTML resource files.
  o Much renaming of code related to database. Particularly "routines" changed
    to "snippets".
  o TDlgAligner class: refactored and added support for dialogs specified by
    window handle.
  o THTMLTpltDlgFrame now uses callbacks to resolve placeholders using a
    THTMLTemplate object: no longer uses TStringList and Name=Value strings.
  o UAnchors.
  o USearch.
  o Some code moved from USnippets into new units and created new DB namespace.
  o Created new DBIO namespace for code that performs database IO.
  o TSnippetsValidator
  o New UStrUtils unit that pulls together and standardises string manipulation
    code.
  o New CRLF constant (= EOL)
  o Moved file name testing code from UUtils to UFileProtocol.
  o New IStringList.ToArray method.
  o New TTextComparer class in UComparers.
  o Some protected interface implementation methods made public.

* Bug fixes:
  o #3120962. This was a separate fix to that created for v3 - the two were
    incompatible.
  o Fixed XML validation bug that was rejecting XML processing instructions with
    "encoding" attributes. This is a copy of v3 fix.
  o Fixed long standing bug that was crashing when database was updated or
    restored after editing, adding or deleting any user defined snippet. This is
    a different fix to that made in v3.
  o Various Unicode and code page related problems in RTF code (see below).

* Help file:
  o Privacy statement topic updated in line with changes to text file.
  o Snippets Editor topic updated re change in snippet name rules.
  o Configure Compiler topic updated for new tab and browse dialog box.
  o Code import topic(s) rewritten re new import wizard.

* Documentation:
  o Privacy statement updated re file name changes.
  o Readme updated re v4 changes.
  o Noted new export file version 5.
  o New documentation for file formats in linked HTML files.

* RTF Support - major changes:
  o Code that makes "safe" RTF modified to write ANSI characters that are
    correct for specified code page, and to use Unicode only where there is no
    ANSI support.
  o Code page of generated RTF now has to be specified.
  o Fixed bug where title destination did not work correctly with Unicode
    characters: used Unicode sub-destinations where necessary per RTF 1.9.1
    spec.
  o New TRTF record provided to encapsulate RTF code. Much RTF related code now
    uses this instead of ANSI strings and streams.
  o Refactored and extended code that load, saves and inserts RTF code to use
    new static record and to use TRTF for the RTF data.

* HTML processing:
  o HTML builder now uses TStringBuilder to create HTML documents.
  o HTML builder no longer wraps embedded CSS code (in style tags) in HTML
    comments.
  o THTMLAttributes can now have attributes passed to constructor to create
    object with attributes on fly rather than having to call Add method for each
    attribute.

Printing:
  o Print engine and print document code updated to used TRTF as document type
    rather than passing data in streams.
  o Title used in print spooler now has default if no title specified.

* Added support for full Unicode Pascal identifiers to be used as snippet names.
  Modified alpha grouping to handle this.

* Clipboard copying code modified to have a method to add each supported format
  to clipboard to enable correct encoding to be used for each format.

* Dialog boxes:
  o Config Compilers Dialog Box:
    - Changed caption of button that detects compilers to "Detect Delphi
      Compilers".
    - Renamed "Command Line" tab to "Switches".
    - Added new "Search Paths" tab.
    - Tabs now each host a frame that provides controls and logic.
    - Custom paint code for compiler list and compiler name banner moved to
      separate classes and units.
    - Created namespace FmCompilersDlg for all subsidiary support units.
    - Corrected and revised Alt keys used in dialog.
  o About Box's Paths tab now disable exlpore buttons if displayed paths don't
    exist. Also paths now appear in hints and include comment if path doesn't
    exist.
  o Added encoding drop down to Save source dialog box where user can choose
    encoding to be used to save files. Provided different choices (or no choice)
    for each file type.
  o Preview dialog box:
    - Simplified handling of captions in preview dialogs. No longer try to
      extract title from document text.
    - Required document type now stated explicitly by calling code. No longer
      detect doc type from content.
  o Compiler error dialog box
    - Compiler log processing pulled out into private inner class.
  o Removed redundant FmHTMLViewDlg unit and THTMLViewDlg intermediate form
    class.
  o New Browse for Folder dialog implementation based on TPJBrowseDialog.
  o Internal changes to FmWizardDlg to suit new sub-class.

* Database:
  o Changed user database dir name to UserData.4.
  o Added support for main database files with .4.* extensions.
  o Main database files now stored in UTF-8 with BOM. Database reader code
    maintains support for reading files in Default encoding because another
    version of CodeSnip may update database using that format.
  o User database file format updated. Now v5.
  o Changes to records and objects:
    - Fields of TSnippetID now encapsulated.

* Import / Export / Backup
  o Updated export file version to v5. All files use v5 regardless of REML
    version used.
  o Code that reads / writes backups completely overhauled.
  o Updated backup file format to v4. Reader maintains backward support for v1
    to v3 and no longer tries to read later formats.
  o Code import:
    - Code overhauled and UI changed (see elsewhere).
    - User info appended to Extra info can now be email or name only or both.
  o Code import now uses byte array instead of stream to read input file.
  o User details code revised.

* Encoding:
  o Added explicit UTF-8 encoding attribute to XML processing instruction of
    export files.
  o User database files now all use UTF-8 encoding (from v5 file format).
    Ability to read earlier formats in default encoding retained.
  o Code submission dialog now sends data to web service as UTF-8.
  o New encoding helper class.
  o Updated data stream reader and writer code to work with specified encodings
    (now defaults to UTF-8 if no encoding provided).
  o Removed all explicit use of Windows-1252. (*** check this ***)
  o Config files now UTF-16LE. TSettings now creates empty blank config files
    if necessary to force Win API to read / write ini files in Unicode.
  o Test units are now saved in UTF-8 if they contain chars that can't be stored
    in default ANSI code page. ANSI still used if possible. Also, unit names are
    restricted to ASCII if necessary to ensure older Delphis (some of which
    support UTF-8 files) can read the unit. (Some Delphis can't open files with
    Unicode or even some ANSI file names).
  o New encoded data structure for passing around binary data with info about
    how it was encoded. Used in the main to replaced strings and streams.
    - Used for database download processing.
    - Used for code export (including code submission).
    - Used for highlighted source code returned from syntax highlighters.
    - Used for documents to be displyed in Preview dialog box.
    - Used in print previews in preferences dialog box.
    - Used when generating snippet information using TRoutineDoc and
      descendants.
    - Used when copying code to clipboard.
    - Replaces most uses of TStringStream.
  o Compiler output encoding can now be set explicitly on a per-compiler
    basis. Currently all compiler use default.

* UI changes:
  o Snippets now displayed in history menu with "Snippet" instead of "Routine"
    prefix.
  o Code Formatting preferences tab now always uses default font name and size
    and preview window enlarged so that longest example code is no longer
    truncated.
  o Code Import now done via wizard rather file open and series of query dialog
    boxes. Import manager code heavily revised to dis-entangle logic from UI.

* Web Services
  o Updated database update web service code changed to work with v5 of the
    codesnip-updt.php web service. Checksums no longer in download but in HTTP
    header.
  o Database update code changed to detect actual encoding used to send data
    from web service and to use that for all encoding / decoding of received
    data.
  o Updated HTTP handling code, and low level web service code, to be able to
    POST byte arrays and receive text responses. Code submitter web service now
    uses this facility.

* IXMLDocumentEx had new LoadFromBytes and SaveToBytes methods: used by code
  import code - see other note re this.

* Revised splash screen to include version number 4.

* Changed syntax highlighter code to no longer use streams to pass text data
  between classes but to use Unicode strings instead.

* Changed per-user config file name to User.4.ini.

* Increased use of TStringBuilder to build strings where string concatenation
  was used excessively.

* Added support for specifying encoding when writing / reading text files.

* Strings containing HTML are now loaded into WebBrowser control as Unicode
  (with BOM), not ANSI text. Characters above #127 in HTML are no longer
  converted to entities.

* Refactored data stream reading / writing code and added code to read / write
  binary formatted data streams. Removed code that writes text formatted data
  streams.
  
* 3rd Party
  o Added PJShellFolders.

* Installer:
  o Updated installer scripts to recognise and copy config files and databases
    from former locations to work with new v4 user config file and database
    directory names.
  o Installer changed so that v4 installs can co-exist - new app id, install
    folder and program group. New locations for common and user app data
    directories.
  o Now uses (and requires) Unicode version of Inno Setup.
  o User config file now v8 and common config file now v6.
