This document contains general notes about the development of CodeSnip v4 along

other documentation, including writing the release 4 change log.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Development started 26 Nov 2010.

* Version numbers set to 3.99.0.0 - will bump third number by one for each
  released alpha or beta version and fourth number will be set to an appropriate
  build number at the time of release.

* Periodic merging of changes from v3 development tree (trunk). Some trunk
  changes ignored where they clash with v4 changes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added a "Tests" directory and project for unit tests.

* Refactorings:
  o View unit - complete rewrite
  o Snippet Kind Info and Initial Letter code - complete rewrite
  o Alpha grouping code
  o TDOSDateTime class.
  o Original installer Pascal Script files.

* Bug fixes:
  o #3120962. This was a separate fix to that created for v3 - the two were
    incompatible.
  o Fixed XML validation bug that was rejecting XML processing instructions with
    "encoding" attributes. This is a copy of v3 fix.
  o Fixed long standing bug that was crashing when database was updated or
    restored after editing, adding or deleting any user defined snippet. This is
    a different fix to that made in v3.

* Help file:
  o Privacy statement topic updated.
  o Snippets Editor topic updated re change in snippet name rules.

* Documentation:
  o Privacy statement updated re config file name change.
  o Readme updated re v4 changes.
  o Noted new export file version 5.
  o New documentation for file formats in linked HTML files.

* Added support for full Unicode Pascal identifiers to be used as snippet names.
  Modified alpha grouping to handle this.

* Dialog boxes:
  o Config Compilers Dialog Box: Changed caption of button that detects
    compilers to "Detect Delphi Compilers".
  o About Box's Paths tab now disable exlpore buttons if displayed paths don't
    exist. Also paths now appear in hints and include comment if path doesn't
    exist.

* Database:
  o Changed user database dir name to UserData.4.
  o Added support for main database files with .4.* extensions.
  o Main database files now stored in UTF-8 with BOM. Database reader code
    maintains support for reading files in Default encoding because another
    version of CodeSnip may update database using that format.
  o User database file format updated. Now v5.

* Import / Export / Backup
  o Updated export file version to v5. All files use v5 regardless of REML
    version used.
  o Code that reads / writes backups completely overhauled.
  o Updated backup file format to v4. Reader maintains backward support for v1
    to v3 and no longer tries to read later formats.

* Encoding:
  o Added explicit UTF-8 encoding attribute to XML processing instruction of
    export files.
  o User database files now all use UTF-8 encoding (from v5 file format).
    Ability to read earlier formats in default encoding retained.
  o Code submission dialog now sends data to web service as UTF-8.
  o New encoding helper class.
  o Updated data stream reader and writer code to work with specified encodings
    (now defaults to UTF-8 if no encoding provided).
  o Removed all explicit use of Windows-1252. (*** check this ***)
  o Config files now UTF-16LE. TSettings now creates empty blank config files
    if necessary to force Win API to read / write ini files in Unicode.

* Web Services
  o Updated database update web service code changed to work with v5 of the
    codesnip-updt.php web service. Checksums no longer in download but in HTTP
    header.
  o Database update code changed to detect actual encoding used to send data
    from web service and to use that for all encoding / decoding of received
    data.

* Revised splash screen to include version number 4.

* Changed syntax highlighter code to no longer use streams to pass text data
  between classes but to use Unicode strings instead.

* Changed per-user config file name to User.4.ini.

* Increased use of TStringBuilder to build strings where string concatenation
  was used excessively.

* Added support for specifying encoding when writing / reading text files.

* Refactored data stream reading / writing code and added code to read / write
  binary formatted data streams. Removed code that writes text formatted data
  streams.

* Installer:
  o Updated installer scripts to recognise and copy config files and databases
    from former locations to work with new v4 user config file and database
    directory names.
  o Installer changed so that v4 installs can co-exist - new app id, install
    folder and program group. New locations for common and user app data
    directories.
  o Now uses (and requires) Unicode version of Inno Setup.
  o User config file now v8 and common config file now v6.
