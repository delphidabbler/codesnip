SOURCE CODE LICENSING

================================================================================

This document discusses and presents the relevant licenses governing the source
code of CodeSnip available for download from DelphiDabbler.com.

The download includes:

+ Original Source Code written by Peter Johnson.
+ Code auto-generated by compilers and other tools.
+ Some third party source code.
+ Source code of some DelphiDabbler libraries required by CodeSnip.
+ Various image files.

The download does not include all the source code required to rebuild CodeSnip.
Explicitly it doesn't include:

+ Source files from the Delphi VCL.
+ The Indy Internet Components.


Original Source Code
================================================================================

Original source files are stored in the the following directories:

+ Src
+ Src\AutoGen
+ Src\Help
+ Src\Help\CSS
+ Src\Help\HTML
+ Src\Install
+ Src\InstallHelper
+ Src\InstallHelper\Res
+ Src\Res\HTML
+ Src\Res\Misc

Any original source code file that is governed by a license has a comment to
that effect in the source. The exception is that .dfm files are considered to be
governed by the same license as their associated .pas file.

Where files are auto-generated, and there are no copyright or license comments
in the files, the licensing of the file depends on how it was generated. If the
file was generated from another source file then the generated file is covered
by the same license as the originating source file. Otherwise the file is placed
in the public domain.

Any other source code files that contain no copyright or license information are
public domain.

Many files are licensed under the Mozilla Public License. A full copy of that
license can be found in MPL.txt


Third Party Source Code
================================================================================

All third party code is stored in the "Src\3rdParty" directory. There are
several such files:

+ GIFImage.pas
  See below for license information.

+ PJMD5.pas
  This is a DelphiDabbler library. The Mozilla Public License v2.0 applies.
  The code derives from the RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest
  Algorithm. See below for the MD5 copyright statement.

+ PJStreamWrapper.pas, PJSysInfo.pas, PJVersionInfo.pas, PJWdwState.pas
  These are all DelphiDabbler libraries. The Mozilla Public License v2.0
  applies.

+ UEncrypt.pas
  Public domain.

License
-------

This software, including documentation, source code, object code and/or
additional materials (TGIFImage) is owned by Anders Melander (the Author).

This License does not provide you with title or ownership of TGIFImage, but only
a right of limited use as outlined in this License agreement. The Author hereby
grants you a non-exclusive, royalty free license to use TGIFImage as set forth
below:

*  integrate TGIFImage with your Applications, subject to the redistribution
   terms below.
*  modify or adapt TGIFImage in whole or in part for the development of
   Applications based on TGIFImage.
*  use portions of the TGIFImage source code or TGIFImage Demo Programs in your
   own products.

Redistribution rights
---------------------

You are granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free right to reproduce and
redistribute executable files created using TGIFImage (the Executable Code) in
conjunction with software products that you develop and/or market (the

Restrictions
------------

Without the expressed, written consent of the Author, you may NOT:

*  distribute modified versions of TGIFImage, in whole or in part.
*  rent or lease TGIFImage.
*  sell any portion of TGIFImage on its own, without integrating it into your
   Applications as Executable Code.

Limited warranty
----------------

There is no warranty or other guarantee of fitness for this software, it is
provided solely "as is". Bug reports or fixes may be sent to the Author, who may
or may not act on them as he desires.

LZW license
-----------

GIF (and thus TGIFImage) uses an adaption of the LZW compression algorithm for
image compression. The LZW algorithm is patented by UNISYS. Unfortunately UNISYS
requires royalty payment for all software that uses the LZW algorithm.

To avoid the use of the LZW algorithm for writing GIFs, TGIFImage can write GIFs
using a LZW compatible RLE compression method. See the TGIFImage.Compression
property for more information. There are conflicting opinions on whether a LZW
license is required to read GIFs. Some patent lawyers are of the opinion that
the LZW patent does not cover LZW decoders, but others disagree. If this matters
to you, you should contact your own lawyer.

For information regarding UNISYS' view on the use of LZW in commercial software,
please read the License Information on GIF and Other LZW-based Technologies. The
UNISYS patent on the LZW algorithm may or may not apply to you depending on the
laws of your country. Personally I have less than warm feelings for Unisys and
their patent and I don't care if you have a license or not.

The LZW patent expires in 2004.

Credit of work
--------------

If you redistribute TGIFImage in binary form (i.e. as a library or linked into
an application), the accompanying documentation (e.g. readme file, help file or
about-box) should state that This software is based, in part, on the work of
Anders Melander or words to that effect.


Image Files (.ico, .bmp, .gif, .png)
