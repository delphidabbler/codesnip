                     - Single extender object now supplied to frame (by
                       calling its new ISetWBExternal interface) rather than
                       frame owning its own custom extender object.
                     - All support for IFrameActionMgr interfaces deleted
                       since the new extender object handles notification of
                       user-initiated events to application.
v0.6 of 23 Feb 2005  - Significantly revised to descend from other frames
                       that implement functionality that is common to all
                       detail view frames. This frame now only implements
                       functions specific to the information frame.

                       document. Uses object in new UWBHighlighter unit to

                       class to enable it to display correct view.
                     - Changed DisplayCurViewItem to override new version in
                       base class to perform any required text search
                       highlighting.
                     - Added code to set CSS specific to information pane.
v1.2 of 04 Feb 2007  - Now uses global query object to find details of
                       current search query rather than use TDetailView
                       object.
                     - Added new parameter to TInfoFrame.Display to force
                       redisplay of view item even if already displayed. This
                       was done to enable pane to highlight or unhilight text
                       search results. We previously used a TDetailView
                       object to do this.
                     - Replaced now redundant TDetailView class references
                       with TViewItem.
v1.3 of 16 Feb 2007  - Revised to work with redefined display interfaces from
                       IntfFrameMgrs.
                     - Pushed Display method back into base class.

                       highlighted by text search highlighter.

                       IDetailViewHostInfo interfaces.
                     - Added CSS relating to HTML used to render REML tags
                       used when displaying Extra information.
