{
 * UCopySourceMgr.pas
 *
 * Implements class that manages copying of a snippet's source code to the
 * clipboard. Code is copied as plain text and as rich text. Rich text version
 * is syntax highlighted.
 *
 * v1.0 of 06 Jun 2009  - Original version containing just TCopySourceMgr.
 * v2.0 of 11 Jul 2009  - Added new TCopySourceCodeBase abtract base class for
 *                        all objects that copy source code to clipboard.
 *                      - Re-implemented TCopySourceMgr as a concrete subclass
 *                        of TCopySourceCodeBase.
 *                      - Added a re-implementation of TCopySnippetMgr, formerly
 *                        defined in UCopySnippetMgr, as a concreate subclass of
 *                        TCopySourceCodeBase.
