{
 * USnippetKindInfo.pas
 *
 * Defines a class that provides information about the different snippet types
 * enumerated by TSnippetKind. The class can only be instantiated as a singleton
 * and can't be freed until the unit is finalised. The class maintains a list of
 * objects representing each snippet kind. Similarly, these object cannot be
 * freed until the owning object is freed.
 *
 * The only reason to go through these convolutions instead of simply providing
 * some structured constant was to retrofit the snippet kind view item to
 * TViewItem. TViewItem expects view items that maintain some value or
 * description (in this case a description of the snippet kind) to be
 * represented as an object to which TViewItem maintains a reference. This means
 * that the lifetime of the object must be greater than any TViewItem. The best
 * way to do this seemed to maintain a list of objects, one per snippet kind,
 * that can't be destroyed until the program closes and have a lifetime the same
 * as the program.
