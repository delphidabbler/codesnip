    <p>
      This dialog box is used to register <em>CodeSnip</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note</strong> You do not have to register <em>CodeSnip</em> to
      use it. However, the author hopes you will register so that he knows that
      <em>CodeSnip</em> is being used and is worth maintaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialog takes the form of a multi-page wizard that gathers
      registration information and submits it online. You move through the
      pages by clicking the <em>Next</em> button and can return to a previous
      page using the <em>Back</em> button. The <em>Cancel</em> button closes
      the wizard without registering the application.
    </p>
    <h2>
      First page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page simply displays some introductory text.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Second page
    </h2>
    <p>
      You use this page to provide information about yourself. As a minimum you
      need to provide your name or a nickname. You can also provide your email
      address. However, this is only required if you wish to subscribe to the
      CodeSnip mailing list. To subscribe you need to check the box below the
      email address field.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can click links on the page to learn more about the CodeSnip <a
       href="mailing_list.htm">mailing list</a> or to read the <a
       href="privacy_statement.htm">privacy statement</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Third page
    </h2>
    <p>
      Along with the information you have entered <em>CodeSnip</em> will have
      collected some information that it will send to the web server. All the
      the information that will be sent is displayed on the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are happy to send the information click the <em>Submit</em> button
      which will have replaced the <em>Next</em> button. <strong>Note:</strong>
      please ensure you are connected to the internet before clicking the
      button.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program will now attempt to connect to <a
       href="http://www.delphidabbler.com"
       target="_blank"
       class="weblink">www.delphidabbler.com</a> and send the registration
      information. If the report is sent successfully the wizard&#39;s final
      page will be displayed. Should an error be detected an error message
      describing the problem will be displayed.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Fourth page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page is shown when the registration has been successful. The
      program&#39;s registration code will be displayed on the page. This value
      is automatically stored by <em>CodeSnip</em> in its configuration file.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have joined the mailing list a message will be displayed that
      confirms this. You will also have been sent an email containing a link
      that you need to click to confirm your registration.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can now close the dialog box by clicking the <em>Finish</em> button
      that has replaced the previous page&#39;s <em>Submit</em> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that each user of the computer where <em>CodeSnip</em> is
      installed must register the program separately.
