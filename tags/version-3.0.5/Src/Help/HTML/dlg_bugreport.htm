       class="glyph"> Bug Report Wizard
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box is used to report bugs online and can be initiated in two
      different ways:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        By the user selecting the <em>Tools | Report Bug Online</em> menu
        option. The dialog box is captioned &quot;Bug Report&quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        Automatically when <em>CodeSnip</em> detects a likely bug. The dialog
        box is captioned &quot;Bug!&quot;
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In either case the dialog box takes the form of a multi-page wizard that
      gathers the necessary data to report the bug. You move through the pages
      by clicking the <em>Next</em> button and can return to a previous page
      using the <em>Back</em> button. The <em>Cancel</em> button closes the
      wizard without reporting the bug.
    </p>
    <h2>
      First page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page differs depending on how the dialog was initiated:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When the dialog is intiated by the user the page is titled <em>Bug
        report wizard</em> and it simply displays a brief introductory message.
      </li>
      <li>
        When displayed because a bug has been detected the page is titled <em>
        CodeSnip has encountered an error</em>. A description of the unexpected
        program event that was detected is displayed on the page along with
        some introductory text.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Second page: <em>Step 1: About the bug</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page is where a description of the bug is entered. Please provide as
      much detail as possible about the effect of the bug and what you were
      doing at the time it was noticed. Whether this description is compulsory
      or optional depends on how the dialog was intiated:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For a user initiated dialog the description is required. An error
        message will be displayed if no description is entered.
      </li>
      <li>
        When <em>CodeSnip</em> displays the dialog automatically the program
        already has some information about the bug (i.e. that which was
        displayed on the first page). Therefore, although additional
        information is helpful, the description is optional. You will be warned
        if you don&#39;t enter a description but you can proceed without
        entering anything.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Third page: <em>Step 2: About you</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      On this page you should enter your email address if you would like a
      reply from the author concerning the bug. This is optional. If you are
      concerened about how your email address will be used click the <a
       href="privacy_statement.htm">privacy statement</a> link that appears on
      the page. <em>CodeSnip</em> does some basic checks on the validity of the
      email address before proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Details of your computer&#39;s operating system are also displayed. This
      information will be included in the bug report.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Fourth page: <em>Step 3: Send the bug report</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The contents of the bug report are displayed on this page. This is done so
      you are aware exactly what information is to be sent. This information
      includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The bug report version.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>CodeSnip</em>&#39;s DelphiDabbler ID, name and version numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Details of your operating system.
      </li>
      <li>
        A description of event that triggered the dialog box (automatic reports
        only).
      </li>
      <li>
        Your description of the bug.
      </li>
      <li>
        You email address, if provided.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are happy to send the information click the <em>Submit</em> button
      which will have replaced the <em>Next</em> button. <strong>Note:</strong>
      please ensure you are connected to the internet before submitting the
      report.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program will now attempt to connect to www.delphidabbler.com and send
      the report to the website&#39;s bug report service. If the report is sent
      successfully the &quot;Finished&quot; page will be displayed. Should an
      error be detected while sending the report an error message describing
      the problem will be displayed.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Fifth page: <em>Finished</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page is displayed when a bug report has been sent successfully. It
      simply displays confirmation that the report was sent. You can close the
      dialog box by clicking the <em>Close</em> button that will have replaced
      the previous page&#39;s <em>Submit</em> button.
