 *
 * Defines class that performs character based access to a stream.
 *
 * v0.1 of 10 Mar 2005  - Original version.
 * v1.0 of 24 May 2006  - Improved and corrected comments.
 *                      - Relocated and rationalised $WARN directives.
 * v1.1 of 14 Jan 2009  - Moved public constants into TTextStreamReader as
 *                        public class constants.
 *                      - Made private section strict.
 *                      - Removed private cCR and cLF constants. We now use CR
 *                        and LF from UConsts.
