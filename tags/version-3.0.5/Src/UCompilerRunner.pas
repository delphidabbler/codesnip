{
 * UCompilerRunner.pas
 *
 * Implements a class that executes a compiler and captures its output and exit
 * code. Also provides specialised exception object that captures information
 * about errors.
 *
 * v0.1 of 11 Jan 2006  - Original version.
 * v0.2 of 11 Apr 2006  - Fixed compiler warning in TCompilerRunner.Execute
 *                        method.
 * v1.0 of 24 May 2006  - Made minor improvements to comments.
 * v1.1 of 25 Aug 2008  - Extended ECompilerRunner exception to have an
 *                        ErrorCode property and added Assign method override.
 *                        Constructor now takes a ECompilerRunner exceptions and
 *                        copies its properties.
 *                      - Made private section of TCompilerRunner strict.
