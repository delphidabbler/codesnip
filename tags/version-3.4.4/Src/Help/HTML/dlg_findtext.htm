      Use this dialog to find specified text within the code snippets database.
      The dialog is displayed from the <em>Search | Find Text</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter the required text in the <em>Text to find</em> combo box. When you
      enter more than one word you can either search for text that contains all
      the words or any of them. Select the appropriate radio button in the <em>
      Search logic</em> group box.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also use the <em>Whole words only</em> check box to ensure that the
      search only looks up words that exactly match those specified. If the
      check box is cleared then words containing the specified text will also
      be found. The search can be made case sensitive by checking the <em>Case
      sensitive</em> check box. If the check box is cleared then case is
      ignored.
