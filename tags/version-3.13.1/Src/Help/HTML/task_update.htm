      Updates to the code snippets database are made available from time to time
      on the web. You can download the latest version of the database easily by
      connecting to the internet then clicking the <img
       src="../Images/Download.gif"
       class="glyph"
       alt="Update Database button"> <em>Update Database from Web</em> toolbar
      button or by choosing the <em>Database | Update From Web</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a
       href="dlg_update.htm">Update From Web dialog box</a> will be displayed.
      Make sure you are connected to the internet then click the <em>Update
      from Web</em> button to begin the update.
    </p>
    <p>
      Database updates apply to all users. This is because only one copy of the
      database exists on the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Updating the database has no effect on any user-defined snippets that have
      been created &ndash; they are not overwritten by the update process.
