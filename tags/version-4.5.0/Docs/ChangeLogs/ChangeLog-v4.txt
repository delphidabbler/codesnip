; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v4.5.0 of 02 May 2013
+ Added support for Delphi XE4 compiler. Implements feature request #78 (http://bit.ly/10uGhoD).
+ Updated documentation re changes.
+ Updated help file re changes.

Release v4.4.2 of 26 April 2013
+ Fixed bugs:
  - #76 (http://bit.ly/12Loz5o) - An advanced record snippet with a method name that clashes with a directive is not test compiling correctly.
  - #77 (http://bit.ly/11I9wXI) Syntax highlighter highlights "contains", "requires" and "package" directives when used in method names.
  - #78 (http://bit.ly/ZQl3T4) - CodeSnip doesn't restore window in correct position when task bar on left or top of screen.

Release v4.4.1 of 09 April 2013
+ Fixed bug #73 "Attempting to check for program updates returns a 404 'Not found' error" (http://bit.ly/Yf3UGy) - this error happened only when using remote server, not localhost test server.

Release v4.4.0 of 08 April 2013
+ Implemented feature request #75 "Check for updates on start-up" (http://bit.ly/ZJ8OGH):
  - CodeSnip checks for both program and Code Snippets Database updates in low priority background threads that run when the program is first started.
  - Update checking takes place at intervals between once per day and once per month.
  - A new "Updates" tab was added to the "Preferences" dialogue box where update frequencies can be chosen, or the auto-update feature switched off. Program and database update checking can be configured individually.
  - Updates are notified via a new slide-in, slide-out notification window that is displayed for a fixed amount of time or until closed by the user. The notification window contains a button that can be used to initiate the appropriate update. For database updates the "Update From Web" dialogue box is opened while for program updates a suitable download web page is displayed in the default browser.
  - Program checking is edition specific, i.e. the standard edition checks for standard edition updates and the portable edition behaves similarly.
+ A new "Update Checks" section was added the welcome screen that gives information about the current auto-update settings and provides a link to change them. Some other text on the screen was tweaked.
+ The "Check For Program Updates" dialogue box now opens the correct version and edition specific web page to download the latest version of CodeSnip instead of simply opening a general download page.
+ A new CodeSnip specific program update web service on the codesnip.delphidabbler.com sub-domain is now used to get information about CodeSnip updates instead of the generic update service on delphidabbler.com.
+ Additional usage information is now sent to the DelphiDabbler Code Snippets database update web service.
+ Some refactoring and code clean-up.
+ The installer may now display an information page that describes the new automatic update checking feature. This page is displayed only when updating from v4.3.0 or earlier to v4.4.0 (or later).
+ Updated help file:
  - Updated and added help topics for all new features of the release.
  - Updated "What's New" topic re new features.
+ Updated documentation, including privacy statement, with information about automatic update checking.
+ Per-user configuration file format changed to v13 which is incompatible with previous versions of CodeSnip.

Release v4.3.0 of 27 February 2013
+ Implemented feature request #40 "Add 'Namespaces' tab to Configure Compilers dialogue box" (http://bit.ly/12XsX32).

Suitable default namespaces are provided if none have been configured.
+ Implemented feature request #70 "Let user specify location of user database" (http://bit.ly/13aNCQZ). This feature is accessed from the new "Move Use Database" option on the Database menu. NOTE: The feature is not available in the portable edition which is designed to keep the user database toegther with the program.
+ Implemented feature request #69 "Enable custom syntax highlighter styles to be saved" (http://bit.ly/XQHkOI). The Syntax Highlighter tab of the Preferences dialogue box has been modified to enable custom syntax highlighter attributes to be saved under a given name and existing named styles to be used or deleted.

+ Unicode support:
  - Program now fully supports Unicode internally.
  - Test units now use UTF-8 format if source code contains non-ANSI characters. ANSI format is used otherwise to permit compilation on older Delphi compilers.
  - Many export file formats now support Unicode and UTF8 formats. User may specify file types from Save dialogue box.
  - Configuration files are now in Unicode format.
  - Some Unicode support added to database (see above).
+ Web service data handling code improved: now includes ability to send raw bytes and can detect and adapt to character encoding used in responses.
+ Common and per-user configuration file names and locations changed. Bumped file version numbers to 6 and 8 respectively.
+ Fixed some bugs:
  - Various Unicode and code page related problems in RTF code generation.
  - Memory leaks.
  - Version detection in backup file restoration.
+ Cascading style sheet handling improved.
+ Any errors in scripts run in browser control now trapped and reported as exceptions instead of via browser control's own error dialogue box.
+ Revised external object that communicates with JavaScript in browser controls.
+ Hyperlinks used in snippets now support the https:// protocol.
+ A default title now used in print spooler if none specified.
+ Source code heavily refactored.
+ Help file updated in line with changes.
+ Installer:
  - Changed so that v3 and v4 installs can co-exist - default install locations are different and v4 does not overwrite v3.
  - Converts v3 config files to v4 Unicode format and copies to new locations. File version stamps are updated.
  - Installer is now compiled with Unicode version of Inno Setup instead of ANSI version.
  - Scripts updated and refactored.
