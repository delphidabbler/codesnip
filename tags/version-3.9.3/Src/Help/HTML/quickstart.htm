    <h1>
      <a
       name="quickstart"></a>QuickStart Guide
    </h1>
    <p>
      This is a guide to getting up and running quickly with <em>CodeSnip</em>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Download the database
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you have not already done so, you need to get an up to date copy of
      the <em>CodeSnip</em> database. You will know if this is the case because
      the program will display a message to that effect when it first starts.
      Use the <a
       href="dlg_update.htm">Update From Web</a> dialog box, reached from the
      <em>Database | Update From Web</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need <em>CodeSnip</em> to access the internet via a Proxy Server
      you should use the <em>Tools | Proxy Server</em> menu option and enter
      information and the proxy in the resulting <a
       href="dlg_proxyserver.htm">Proxy Server Configuration</a> dialog box.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Customise the Database
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can add your own snippets to the database. These snippets are held 
      separately to the main database and are not affected by database updates.
      If you wish you can submit user defined code to be considered for
      inclusion in the main database.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add, edit and delete snippets using the appropriate menu items on the 
      <em>Database</em> menu. You can also save, backup and restore the user
      database from this menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snippets can be categorised using any of the available categories or you
      can defined your own.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Navigating the database
    </h2>
    <p>
      Make sure you have the
      <a href="detail_information.htm">Information tab</a> of the
      <a href="detail_pane.htm">Detail Pane</a> selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the snippets in the database are displayed in the
      <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a>, grouped in different ways
      depending on which tab is selected. Select the name of a snippet in the
      Overview Pane to display its source code, description and other
      information in the Detail Pane. Any snippets required to compile
      the displayed snippet are listed in the &quot;Required snippets&quot;
      section. Clicking a snippet's name displays its details. Similar
      snippets are accessible in the &quot;See also&quot; section. The
      compilers the snippet is known to compile with are inidacted at the bottom
      of the display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking a section heading in the Overview Pane displays a table listing
      all the snippets in that section in the Detail Pane. Clicking any snippet
      name will display the snippet's details.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Searching the database
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can search the database for specific words, for snippets that
      compile (or don't compile) under certain compilers or for
      cross-referenced snippets. Use the <a href="dlg_findtext.htm">Find
      Text</a>, <a href="dlg_findcompiler.htm">Find Compiler</a> or
      <a href="dlg_findxrefs.htm">File Cross References</a> dialog boxes to
      perform a search. These dialogs are accessed via the
      <a href="menu_search.htm">Search</a> menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a search has been performed only those snippets that are found are
      listed in the <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a>. When a text
      search is performed the found words are highlighted in the detail pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cancel a search and view all the database again, select the <em>Search
      | Show All</em> menu item.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Test Compiling Snippets
    </h2>
    <p>
      When any snippet is selected you can test it with any supported compilers
      currently installed on your computer, provided it is not a 
      <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">freeform</a> snippet. To do this you must
      first have configured <em>CodeSnip</em> to work with your compilers by
      providing the required information in the
      <a href="dlg_configcompilers.htm">Configure Compilers</a> dialog box.
    </p>
    <p>
      To perform a test compilation select the required snippet in the Overview
      pane. Then select the <a href="detail_compilerchecks.htm">Compiler Checks
      tab</a> in the <a href="detail_pane.htm">Detail Pane</a>. The program will
      display a list of all supported compilers along with &quot;LEDs&quot; that
      indicate which compilers should compile the snippet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the <em>Test Compile Snippet</em> link to perform the compilation.
      This may take a few seconds. Once the last compilation has completed the
      display will change to show the results. If the compilation failed, or
      resulted in warnings, a link will appear that will report the errors or
      warnings generated by the compiler.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Exporting Snippets
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> can export snippets or complete units, as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any selected routine can be exported to a file using the
        <a href="dlg_savesnippet.htm">Save Snippet</a> dialog box accessed from
        the <em>File | Save Snippet</em> menu option.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plain text copies of selected snippets can be copied to the clipboard
        via the <em>Edit | Copy Snippet</em> or <em>Edit | Copy Source Code</em>
        menu options.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete Pascal units can be generated and written to file. The unit
        will contain all the currently selected snippets (i.e. those displayed
        in the <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a>). You can
        explicitly specify the selected snippets by using the
        <a href="dlg_selectroutines.htm">Select Snippets</a> dialog box
        available via <em>Search | Select Snippets</em>. The unit is configured
        and saved from the <a href="dlg_saveunit.htm">Save Unit</a> dialog box,
        displayed from the <em>File | Save Unit</em> menu option.
      </li>
      <li>
        User-defined snippets can be exported to a file that can be imported by
        other <em>CodeSnip</em> users.
      </li>
    </ul>
