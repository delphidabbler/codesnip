      Overview Pane
    </h1>
    <p>
      This pane appears on the left hand side of the main window. It lists all
      the snippets in the database. Snippets can be grouped in three ways:
      by category, using the <em>Categorised</em> tab, alphabetically, using the
      <em>Alphabetical</em> tab or by <a href="snippet_kinds.htm">snippet
      kind</a> using the <em>Snippet Kind</em> tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selecting an item in the overview pane causes detailed information about
      it to appear in the <a href="detail_pane.htm">Detail Pane</a>'s
      <a href="detail_information.htm">Information tab</a>. Selecting a snippet
      displays a description and its source code while selecting a section
      heading lists all the currently selected routines in the section along
      with their descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nodes of the tree used to display the routines can be expanded and
      collapsed using the
      <img
        src="../images/expand.gif"
        alt="Expand toolbar button"
        class="glyph"
      > or
      <img
        src="../images/collapse.gif"
        alt="Collapse toolbar button"
        class="glyph"
      >  buttons in the title of the pane, or by using the various expand and
      collapse options on the <em>View</em> menu.
