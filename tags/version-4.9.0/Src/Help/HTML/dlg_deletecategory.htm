    <p>
      This dialogue is used to delete a user-defined category from the database.
      It is accessed from the <em>Categories | Delete Category</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the category to be deleted from the list box. If the selected
      category is non-empty, i.e. it contains snippets then it can't be deleted
      and a message wil be displayed to that effect. Once a suitable category is
      selected simply click the <em>Delete</em> button to delete it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Delete</em> button will be disabled if you haven't selected a
      category from the list box or if the category can't be deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have noticed that some user defined categories do not appear in
      the list of categories to be deleted. This is because some categories are
      required by <em>CodeSnip</em> and cannot be deleted, although they can be
      renamed.
