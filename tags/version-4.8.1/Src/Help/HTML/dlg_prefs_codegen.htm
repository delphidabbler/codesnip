    <p>
      This tab of the <a href="dlg_preferences.htm">Preferences</a> dialogue box
      is used to customise the source code emitted by the code generator for
      test compilations and generated units.
    <p>
      The tab is accessed by selecting the <em>Tools | Preferences</em> menu
      item then clicking the <em>Code Generation</em> tab.
      <strong>Note:</strong> This tab is not used to modify the <em>style</em>
      of the source code: use the <a href="dlg_prefs_sourcecode.htm">Code
      Formatting</a> tab for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Code Generator can be configured to generate $WARN compiler directives
      to switch specified warning messages on or off. These directives are
      supported by Delphi 6 and later.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enable this facility you must check the <em>Emit $WARN directives</em>
      check box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warnings for which compiler directives are to be generated are those
      listed in the list view control situated below the check box. Warnings
      are identified by the text in the <em>Symbol</em> column. These symbols
      must be valid parameters for Delphi's $WARN directive. Since new symbols
      have been introduced in different versions of Delphi, the minimum version
      of the compiler that supports the warning must also be specified. This is
      shown in the <em>Min. Compiler</em> column of the list view. The version
      number is that specified by the Delphi's <a
        href="http://wiki.delphidabbler.com/index.php/Notes/VersionNumbers"
        class="weblink"
      ><var>CompilerVersion</var> constant.</a>. Finally, whether a warning is
      switched on or off is shown in the <em>State</em> column.
    </p>
    <p>
      The list view can be sorted on the contents of any of the columns by
      clicking the appropriate column header. Clicking the same column header
      again reverses the sort. The header of the sorted column displays an
      indicator showing the sort direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      New symbols can be added and existing symbols updated or deleted by using
      the controls below the list view, as follows:
    </p>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        <strong>Add a symbol</strong><br>
        Enter the symbol name in the <em>Symbol</em> edit control, specify the
        earliest compiler version that supports it in the <em>Min. Compiler</em>
        edit control and specify whether the $WARN directive will switch the
        warning on or off by selecting the appropriate <em>Warning State</em>
        radio button. Click the <em>Add</em> button to add the symbol to the
        list. If the <em>Add</em> button remains disabled check that the
        compiler version is valid and that the symbol name does not already
        exist.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Delete a symbol</strong><br>
        Select the required symbol in the list view then click the
        <em>Delete</em> button. The symbol will be removed from the list.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Update a symbol</strong><br>
        Select the symbol to be updated from the list view. It's details will be
        copied into the <em>Symbol</em> and <em>Min. Compiler</em> edit
        controls and the appropriate <em>Warning State</em> radio button will be
        selected. Change the details as required then click the <em>Update</em>
        button to modify the symbol. The changes will be reflected in the list
        view. If the entered information is not valid then the <em>Update</em>
        button will be disabled.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <em>Pre-defined</em> button next to the <em>Min. Compiler</em> edit
      control is provided to make it easier to choose the minimum compiler
      version. Clicking the button drops down a menu which displays the names
      of some Delphi compilers. Choosing a compiler will enter the correct
      version number in the edit control. <strong>Note:</strong> The earliest
      supported compiler version is 14.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Preview</em> button at the top right of the tab displays the
      source code that will be emitted by the code generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Restore Defaults</em> button discards the current list of $WARN
      directives and replaces it with a default set.
