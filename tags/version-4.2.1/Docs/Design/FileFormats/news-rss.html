<h1>
  News RSS Stream
</h1>

<p>
  CodeSnip downloads news about the program and database as an RSS feed from
  DelphiDabbler.com.
</p>

<p>
  The feed is generated as an RSS XML document using the default encoding used
  by the DelphiDabbler web server, ISO-8859-1. The XML document has no encoding
  information embedded in it.
</p>

<p>
  CodeSnip's HTTP handling code gets the RSS document as text and converts it to
  a Unicode string using the encoding indicated by the web service (ISO-8859-1
  by default).
</p>

<p>
  The XML is then parsed as a Unicode string.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, although no explicit encoding information is embedded in the XML,
  the document is translated to Unicode correctly and information is preserved.
