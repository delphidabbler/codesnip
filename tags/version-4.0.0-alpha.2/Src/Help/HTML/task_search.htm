    <h1>
      <a name="task_search"></a>Search the Database
    </h1>
    <p>
      You can search the code snippets database for text, by compiler or for
      cross-referenced snippets. You can also manually select which snippets are
      displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a search is performed only those snippets matching the search
      criteria are displayed. A second search will reset the previous search.
    </p>
    <p>
      Restore the full database after a search by clicking the
      <img alt="Show All button" src="../images/FindClear.gif" class="glyph">
      <em>Show All</em> toolbar button or by selecting <em>Search | Show
      All</em>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Text search
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can search for all snippets containing one or more words. Use the
      <img alt="Find Text button" src="../images/FindText.gif" class="glyph">
      <em>Find Text</em> toolbar button (or select <em>Search | Find Text</em>)
      and enter the search text in the
      <a href="dlg_findtext.htm">Find Text Dialog Box</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Compiler search
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can search for snippets that compile, fail to compile or that have not
      been tested on certain compilers. Use the
      <img
        alt="Find Compiler button"
        src="../images/FindCompiler.gif"
        class="glyph"
      > <em>Find Compiler</em> toolbar button (or select <em>Search | Find
      Compiler</em>) and enter the search criteria in the
      <a href="dlg_findcompiler.htm">Find Compiler Dialog Box</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Cross-reference search
    </h2>
    <p>
      This search is provided to enable you to find snippets that are related to
      one another. The search finds snippets referenced by the currently
      selected snippet. Cross references via the &quot;see also&quot; or
      &quot;required snippets&quot; fields can be searched, and searches can be
      recursive.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run the search select a snippet in the
      <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a> then select <em>Search |
      Find Cross Refs</em> and configure the search in the 
      <a href="dlg_findxrefs.htm">Find Cross References</a> dialog box.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Manual selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      Using the
      <img
        alt="Select Routines button"
        src="../images/SelectRoutines.gif"
        class="glyph"
      > <em>Select Snippets</em> toolbar button (or selecting <em>Search |
      Select Snippets</em>) you can explicitly choose which snippets are to be
      displayed in the <a href="overview_pane.htm">Overview Pane</a>. This is
      done in the <a href="dlg_selectroutines.htm">Select Snippets</a> dialog
      box by simply placing a check mark next to the required snippets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this option is to select snippets for inclusion in a
      generated Pascal unit. See the <a href="task_generateunit.htm">Generate
      Unit</a> task for information about generating a unit.
