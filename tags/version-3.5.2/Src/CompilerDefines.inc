  Supported symbols are:

  CanCompile
    Defined if compiler can be used to compile CodeSnip.

  SupportsMainFormOnTaskBar
    Defined for compilers that have the TApplication.MainFormOnTaskBar property.
    When not defined the program needs to provide the correct Vista
    compatibility.

  SupportsUseLatestCommonDialogs
    Defined for compilers that support the UseLatestCommonDialogs global
    variable that is used to enable or disable Vista style common dialogs.

  AltBugFixNeeded
    Defined for compilers that exhibit the Alt Key Bug and need the program to
    provide a fix. (For details of the Alt Key Bug see Embarcadero Quality
    Central bug report #37403.)

  ThreadResumeDeprecated
    Defined for compilers where TThread.Resume is a deprecated method.
