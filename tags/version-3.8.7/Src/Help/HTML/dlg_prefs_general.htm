      General application settings can be modified by using this tab of the
      <a
        href="dlg_preferences.htm"
      >Preferences</a> dialog box. The tab is accessed by selecting the
      <em>Tools | Preferences</em> menu item then clicking the <em>General</em>
      tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two groups of options that can be set.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Display
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this section you can determine how the program displays at start-up. At
      present there is just one option: to choose how the <a
        href="overview_pane.htm"
      >overview pane</a> appears when the program starts. Do this using the
      <em>Start overview pane treeview as</em> drop down list to choose either
      <em>Fully expanded</em> to make the treeview display all entries) or
      <em>Fully collapsed</em> to display only section headers.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Measurement
    </h2>
    <p>
      Select the measurement units to be used by the application from the
      <em>Preferred units of measurement</em> drop down list. Options are
      <em>Inches</em> and <em>Millimeters</em>. If you have not set this option
      before, the measurement units will default to your locale settings.
