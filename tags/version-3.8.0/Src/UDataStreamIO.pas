  About data streams

  Data streams are always composed of text strings. Numbers are encoded as
  strings of hex digits.
  Text contained in the streams should be encoded in the Windows-1252 code page.
  Characters occupy 1 byte.

  There are several "data types":
  + SmallInt          = 16 bit integer encoded as 4 hex digits
  + LongInt           = 32 bit integer encoded as 8 hex digits
  + Int64             = 64 bit integer encoded as 16 hex digits
  + SizedString       = variable length string of 1 byte chars preceeded by
                        a SmallInt that gives the number of characters
  + SizedLongString   = variable length string of 1 byte chars preceeded by
                        a LongInt that gives the number of characters
  + Character         = a single 1 byte character

  There is a pseudo-data type - the fixed size string that is composed of a
  known number of Characters.

  There is no meta-data in the stream to describe the data type of an element of
  the file. The reader / writer must have knowledge of the file format being
  read / written.
