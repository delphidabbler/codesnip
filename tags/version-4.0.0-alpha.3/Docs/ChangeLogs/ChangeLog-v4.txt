+ New features:
  - Compiler warnings can now be switched on as well as off in generated code.
  - Names and descriptions of snippets in a category can now be printed.

  - Code Generation tab of Preferences dialogue box updated to enable warnings to be switched on or off. In addition default warnings can be restored, list view columns can be sorted and Alt key shortcuts tweaked.
  - Code Import dialogue box improved: now sorts imported units in list view and scrolls to make renamed snippets visible.
  - Snippet selection and cross-reference search dialogues now report if existing search results will be overwritten.
  - Text and compiler search dialogues now ask if any current search results are to be refined.
  - Tree views in Snippet Selection, Snippets export and Snippets submission dialogue boxes can now be expanded and collapsed.

  - New "classes" snippet type that enables a single Object Pascal class or advanced record-with-methods to be stored in database, test compiled and included in generated units.
