{
  Internally, URIDecode operates on UTF-8 strings for both input and output.

  This lets us deal easily with any multi-byte characters in the input. There
  SHOULDN'T be any such characters since all characters in a percent encoded URI
  should map onto the unreserved characters from the ASCII character set.
  However we need to allow for badly encoded URIs that *may* contain characters
  outside this expected set.

  UTF-8 also lets perform an easy test for '%' characters in input. Since '%'
  can never occur and a UTF-8 continuation character we can simply test for the
  actual character without worrying about if it is part of of a multibyte
  character.

  We use UTF-8 for the output string since UTF-8 should have been used to encode
  the URI in the first place, therefore percent-encoded octets may map onto
  UTF-8 continuation bytes. Using any other string type would give erroneous
  results.

  We convert interim UTF-8 result into the native string type before returning.

{
  Extract from RFC 3986 section 2.5:
    "the data should first be encoded as octets according to the UTF-8 character
    encoding [STD63]; then only those octets that do not correspond to
    characters in the unreserved set should be percent-encoded.

  These means we can simply scan a UTF-8 string and encode anything we find that
  isn't in the unreserved set. We need't worry about any continuation bytes in
  the UTF-8 encoding because all continuation bytes are greater than $80, and
  all unreserved characters are from a sub-set of ASCII and therefore have an
  ordinal value of less than $80. So we needn't worry about detecting lead and
  continuation bytes.

  For details of the UTF-8 encoding see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8

  NOTE:
    URIEncode should be applied to the component parts of the URI before they
    are combined, not to the whole URI. See RFC 3986 section 2.4
