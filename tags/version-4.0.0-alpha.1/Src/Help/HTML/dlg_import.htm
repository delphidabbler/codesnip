    </h1>
    <p>
      This wizard is used to import user defined snippets from a file exported
      by another user. It is accessed from the <em>Database | Import
      Snippets</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The different pages of the wizard are discussed below. You can cancel the
      import any time the <em>Cancel</em> button is enabled.
    </p>
    <h2>
      First page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is simply an introductory page that describes the wizard. Click the
      <em>Next</em> button to display the <em>Choose import file</em> page.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;Choose import file&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page is used to specify the file you want to import. Enter the file
      name in the <em>Open import file</em> edit box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, the required file can be chosen from the standard Windows
      <a
        href="dlg_importfile.htm"
      >Import File</a> dialog box. Click the ellipsis button to the right of the
      edit control to display it. The name of the selected file is copied to
      the <em>Open import file</em> edit box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Files exported from <em>CodeSnip</em> usually have a .csexp extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a suitable file has be specified click the <em>Next</em> button to
      load the file and move to the next page of the wizard. The database is
      not updated at this stage, so if you made a mistake you can return to this
      page and choose another file.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;User information&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> This page is not shown if the selected import file
      does not contain any user information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>User information</em> page simply displays any information that
      the person who created the file provided. There are three items of
      information that may be present:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <em>Name</em> - the name or nickname of the person who created the file.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Email</em> - the email address of the person who created the file.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Comments</em> - any comments about the content of the file.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Any of these items of information can be empty. Comments are for
      information only but the name and email will be added to the end of the
      imported snippet's <em>Extra</em> information field. This will be in the
      form &quot;Contributed by Name &ltEmail&gt;&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>Next</em> to go to the next page.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;Edit import and update database&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page lets you rename or reject any of the imported snippets before
      adding them to the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each snippet in the import file is listed in a grid. The columns are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Snippet Name</em><br>
        This is the name of the snippet in the import file, i.e. the name of the
        snippet in the file exporter's database. Clear the check box next to the
        snippet if you don't want to import it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Import Using Name</em><br>
        This is that name that will be used for the snippet when it is imported.
        If there is already a snippet in your database with the same name as
        that given in the <em>Snippet Name</em> column, the entry in this column
        will have been altered to make it unique in your database. Any names in
        this column can be edited (see below).
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Action</em><br>
        This column describes what will happen to this snippet when the database
        is updated. It will either be &quot;Import&quot; if the snippet will be
        imported (check box checked) or &quot;Skip&quot; if the snippet will not
        be imported (check box cleared).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Selecting one of the rows in the grid copies the snippet name from the
      <em>Import Using Name</em> column into the <em>Selected Snippet</em> edit
      control. You can rename the snippet by entering a new name here then
      clicking the <em>Rename</em> button. The new name is validated before
      being displayed in the grid. You can't use the name of a snippet that is
      already in your user database or is the name one of the other snippets in
      the import list.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are ready to perform the import click the <em>Update</em> button
      to update the database. There will be a pause while the snippets are
      imported then the final wizard page will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newly imported snippets will be located in the &quot;Imported
      Snippets&quot; database category ready for you to move or edit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Once the <em>Update</em> button has been clicked
      you can't cancel or undo the update.
    </p>
    <p>
      If no snippets have been selected an error message will be displayed when
      the <em>Update</em> button is clicked.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;Import complete&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page is displayed once the database update has completed. It simply
      lists the names of the snippets that have been imported.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close the wizard by clicking the <em>Finish</em> button. Note that the
      <em>Back</em> button is disabled because you can't undo the update.
    </p>
