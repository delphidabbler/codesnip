        href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/codesnip"
      >Code Snippets Database</a> of reusable Delphi Pascal procedures,
      functions, types and constants. The program can download the database from
      the <em>DelphiDabbler</em> website and display it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the program you can navigate and search the database. Snippets
      can be displayed and test compiled. You can write code snippets to disk
      and the clipboard or generate whole Pascal units. The database can be
      updated from internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also add your own routines, types and constants to the database.
      <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">Freeform</a> code can also be added, but
      can't be test compiled.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Welcome Page
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the program starts it displays its welcome page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time the program is run the welcome page notes that the database
      is empty and prompts you to download the database. On subsequent occasions
      the welcome page gives a brief overview of the program and links to some
      useful actions. A <em>Donation</em> button is also displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The welcome page can be displayed at any time by selecting the <em>View |
      Welcome Page</em> menu option.
