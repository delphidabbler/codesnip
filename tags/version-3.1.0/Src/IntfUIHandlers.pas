 * Interfaces, records and constants used when hosting the IE WebBrowser Control
 * or automating IE to replace the menus, toolbars, and context menus. The
 * content of the unit is based on Microsoft UI documentation from MSDN. Not all
 * the structures and constants are used in CodeSnip.
 *
 * v0.1 of 30 Jan 2005  - Original version.
 * v0.2 of 18 Feb 2005  - Commented out some DOCHOSTUIFLAG_* constants that
 *                        appear to have erroneous values.
 * v1.0 of 24 May 2006  - Improved and corrected comments.
 *                      - Relocated and rationalised $WARN directives.
 * v1.1 of 14 Jan 2009  - Provided correct values for commented-out
 *                        DOCHOSTUIFLAG_* flags.
 *                      - Added new DOCHOSTUIFLAG_* flags introduced with IE6
 *                        for XP SP2 and IE7.

    Set of flags that indicate the capabilities of an IDocHostUIHandler

    {Not implemented}

  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_DIV_BLOCKDEFAULT                = $00000100;

    this flag, MSHTML will use the p tag}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_ACTIVATE_CLIENTHIT_ONLY         = $00000200;
    {MSHTML only becomes UI active if the mouse is clicked in the client area of
    the window. It does not become UI active if the mouse is clicked on a
    nonclient area, such as a scroll bar}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_OVERRIDEBEHAVIORFACTORY         = $00000400;
    {MSHTML consults the host before retrieving a behavior from the URL
    specified on the page. If the host does not support the behavior, MSHTML
    does not proceed to query other hosts or instantiate the behavior itself,
    even for behaviors developed in script (HTML Components (HTCs))}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_CODEPAGELINKEDFONTS             = $00000800;
    {IE5 or later. Provides font selection compatibility for Outlook Express. If
    the flag is enabled, the displayed characters are inspected to determine
    whether the current font supports the code page. If disabled, the current
    font is used, even if it does not contain a glyph for the character. This
    flag assumes that the user is using IE5 and OE4.0}

    hosted browser. The Intelliforms feature is only turned on if the user has
    previously enabled it. If the user has turned the AutoComplete feature off
    for forms, it is off whether this flag is specified or not}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_ENABLE_INPLACE_NAVIGATION       = $00010000;
    {IE5 or later. This flag enables the host to specify that navigation should
    happen in place. This means that applications hosting MSHTML directly can
    specify that navigation happen in the application's window. For instance,
    if this flag is set, you can click a link in HTML mail and navigate in the
    mail instead of opening a new IE window}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_IME_ENABLE_RECONVERSION         = $00020000;
    {IE5 or later. During initialization, the host can set this flag to enable
    Input Method Editor (IME) reconversion, allowing computer users to employ

    {IE6 or later. Turns off any 3-D border on the outermost frame or frameset
    only. To turn borders off on all frame sets, use DOCHOSTUIFLAG_NO3DBORDER}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_DISABLE_EDIT_NS_FIXUP           = $00400000;
    {IE6 or later. Disables the automatic correction of namespaces when editing
    HTML elements}

    non-HTML document types}

    fired when redirect navigations occur}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_USE_WINDOWLESS_SELECTCONTROL    = $08000000;
    {IE7 or later. The Document Object Model (DOM) is used to create native
    "windowless" select controls that can be visually layered under other
    elements}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_USE_WINDOWED_SELECTCONTROL      = $10000000;

    drop-down controls}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_ENABLE_ACTIVEX_INACTIVATE_MODE  = $20000000;
    {IE6 for Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) and later. Requires user activation
