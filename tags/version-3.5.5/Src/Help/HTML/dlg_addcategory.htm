    <p>
      This dialog is used to create a new, empty, user-defined category. It is
      accessed from the <em>Database | Add Category</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter a description of the category in the edit box and click OK to add it
      to the database. The description you provided will be used to identify the
      category in program, so keep it brief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leading and trailing spaces are ignored. If you enter an existing
      description a warning to that effect is displayed below the edit box. The
      <em>OK</em> button will be disabled if you haven't entered any text or if
      the entry is not valid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the new category may not appear in the
      <a href="overview_pane.htm">overview pane</a> because it is empty. It will
      however be available to use when editing snippets.
