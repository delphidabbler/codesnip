      First Run Wizard
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box appears only when you run <em>CodeSnip 4</em> for the
      first time after updating from <em>CodeSnip 3</em> or earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its purpose is to enable you to preserve preferences from the earlier
      version of <em>CodeSnip</em> and to import any user snippets database you
      may have created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notes: If you run <em>CodeSnip 4</em> as a different user you may see this
      dialogue box again since it performs configuration on a per-user basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue box takes the form of a multi-page wizard. You can't cancel
      or close the dialogue box prematurely: you must go through each step. It
      won't take long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each page of the wizard is described below.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Introductory page
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the wizard appears you see an introductory page entitled &quot;New
      version of CodeSnip&quot;. This page simply provides some information
      about the wizard along with some brief instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>Next</em> to go to the next page. This will probably be the
      <em>Preferences</em> page, but on rare occasions you may see the
      <em>Snippets database</em> page instead.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;Preferences&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page appears if an earlier preferences file has been detected. It
      enables you to preserve the preferences used by your earlier version of
      <em>CodeSnip</em>. Make sure the check box is ticked to do this, or clear
      it if you would prefer to use <em>CodeSnip 4</em> with its default
      settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most preferences from earlier versions can be preserved, with a few
      exceptions for older versions of the program. These are:
    </p>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        <div>
          Any syntax highlighter customisation you have made will be lost if you
          are updating from any v2 or earlier release.
        </div>
        <div>
          You will need to redo any customisation using the <a
            href="dlg_prefs_hiliter.htm"
          >Syntax Highlighter</a> tab of the <a
            href="dlg_preferences.htm"
          >Preferences</a> dialogue box.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          If you are updating from v3.6.0 or earlier and have set up a password
          protected proxy server for internet access you will need to re-enter
          the password since it will have been lost. This is because format for
          storing passwords changed at v3.6.1.
        </div>
        <div>
          To re-enter your proxy password use the <a
            href="dlg_proxyserver.htm"
          >Proxy Server Configuration</a> dialogue box.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          Your source code formatting preferences will have been lost if you
          are updating from v1.7.4 or earlier.
        </div>
        <div>
          You will need to reconfigure them using the <a
            href="dlg_prefs_sourcecode.htm"
          >Code Formatting</a> tab of the <a
            href="dlg_preferences.htm"
          >Preferences</a> dialogue box.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          If you are updating from v1.8.11 or earlier and have registered
          <em>CodeSnip</em> you registration information will have been lost.
        </div>
        <div>
          You can check this by displaying the <a
            href="dlg_about.htm"
          >About</a> dialogue box and checking the <em>About The Program</em>
          tab. If it displays a <em>Register CodeSnip</em> button the program
          is not registered. You can (re)register if you wish by clicking the
          button.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once you have decided whether to preserve preferences or not, click the
      <em>Next</em> button. This will take you to the <em>Snippets database</em>
      page or the <em>Summary</em> page, depending on whether a user defined
      snippets database has been found.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;Snippets database&quot;
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page appears if a user-defined snippets database has been detected.
      It enables you to create a copy of the database suitable for use by
      <em>CodeSnip 4</em>. To do this ensure that the check box is ticked. If
      you prefer to abandon the database, clear the check box.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do create a copy of the database any changes you make to it will
      not be reflected in the earlier copy, or vice versa. This is because a
      snippets database updated by <em>CodeSnip 4</em> ceases to be readable by
      earlier versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> If you don't install the old database you can still
      export snippets from it later that can be imported into <em>CodeSnip
      4</em> at a later date, provided you don't uninstall the older version of
      <em>CodeSnip</em>. See <a
        href="task_export.htm"
      >Exporting and Importing Snippets</a> for further information.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;Summary&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page summarises the actions you are taking. It is your last chance to
      change your mind before committing yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should read the information carefully, and use the <em>Back</em>
      button to go back to the earlier pages if you want to change anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are ready click the <em>Confirm</em> button to configure
      <em>CodeSnip 4</em>. <span class="warning">There is no undo</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      &quot;Finished&quot; page
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page is displayed after the configuration is complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you preversed your preference and any loss of information has been
      detected, or is possible, the information is listed here. See the
      &quot;Preferences&quot; page section above for details. Otherwise the
      page simply reports that the process is complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>Finish</em> to close the wizard. <em>CodeSnip 4</em> will now
      load.
