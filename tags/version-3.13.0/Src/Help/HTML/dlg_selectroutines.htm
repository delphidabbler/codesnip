    </h1>
    <p>
      Use this dialog to manually select the snippets that are displayed. The
      dialag is displayed from the <em>Search | Select Snippets</em> menu
      option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snippets are selected simply by placing a check mark next to the name of
      the required snippets. Checking or unchecking a category will select or
      de-select all the snippets in the category. When the dialog box appears
      all snippets currently displayed by the program are selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also four buttons that can be used to select or deselect groups
      of snippets. The options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Select All</em> selects all the snippets in the database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Clear All</em> deselects all the snippets in the database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>User Defined</em> selects all the user defined snippets in the
        database. The button will be disabled if there are no user defined
        snippets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Main</em> selects all the snippets in the main database. If there
        are no user defined snippets <em>Main</em> has the same effect as
        <em>Select All</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When the selection has been made, click the <em>OK</em> to accept the
      changes. At least one snippet must be selected. Click <em>Cancel</em> to
      abort your selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of the Select Snippets dialog box is to enable you to
      specify precisely which snippets will be included in a generated unit.
      See the <a href="task_generateunit.htm">Generate Unit</a> task for
