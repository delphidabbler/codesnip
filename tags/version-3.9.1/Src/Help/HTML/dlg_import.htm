      <a name="dlg_import"></a>Import Snippets Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box is used to import user defined snippets from a
      <em>CodeSnip</em> export files received from other <em>CodeSnip</em> users
      into the user defined database. The dialog box is opened from the
      <em>Database | Import Snippets</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialog box is a standard windows dialog box. Choose the required
      import file from it. Start the import by clicking <em>OK</em>. The import
      can be cancelled by clicking <em>Cancel</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On clicking <em>OK</em> the import process starts. If any of the imported
      snippets has a name that clashes with a snippet in the existing
      user database then a subsidiary dialog box is displayed querying whether
      to overwrite the existing snippet, skip importing the snippet, rename the
      imported snippet or cancel the whole import. If you choose to rename a
      snippet the a further dialog box is displayed where the new name can be
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the import completes a message box is displayed giving the names of
      the imported snippets. If no snippets are imported a message box informs
      you of this.
    </p>
  </body>
