      About The SWAG Database
    </h1>
    <p>
      SWAG is a collection of source code and program examples for the Pascal
      programming language that was maintained up to the end of 1997.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the SWAG database is old it is extensive and some of the code is
      still relevant for today's programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> provides the
      <a href="dlg_swagimport.htm">SWAG Import Wizard</a> that enables you to
      browse the SWAG database and import any of its snippets into your own
      snippets database.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can browse the archive online using the <a
