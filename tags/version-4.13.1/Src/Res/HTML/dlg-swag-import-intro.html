      This wizard enables you to import one or more snippets from the online <a
        class="help-link"
        href="help:AboutSWAG"
      >SWAG database</a> into your local user database.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you click the &quot;Next&quot; button, <em>CodeSnip</em> will
      download a list of categories from the SWAG database. Double-click on a
      category to see a list of the snippets it contains. You can then select
      the snippet(s) you want to import using the check boxes that appear next
      to each snippet. Double-clicking a snippet lets you view it.
    </p>

    <p>
      To help you to decide what to import you can
      <a
        class="external-link"
        href="http://swag.delphidabbler.com"
      >view the SWAG database</a> in your browser. Make a note of the names of
      the snippet(s) you are interested in, along with their categories. That
      will help you find them in this wizard.
    </p>

    <p>
      All snippets are imported as <a
        class="help-link"
        href="help:SnippetFreeform"
      >freeform</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> does not keep a track of snippets imported from the SWAG
      database &ndash; it treats them just like any other user defined snippet.
      This means that you will be able to import the same snippet more than once
      and it's up to you to keep track of this.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      It can take quite some time to import SWAG snippets. You are advised not
      to import more than about 20 snippets in one go. If you want to import a
      lot of snippets you should run this wizard more than once.
