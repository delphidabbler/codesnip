    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue is used to duplicate the currently selected snippet,
      creating a new user defined snippet. The dialogue box is accessed from the
      <em>Snippet | Duplicate Snippet</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter a unique name of the duplicated snippet in the edit control. A
      suitable name will be suggested. When duplicating a snippet from the main
      database it may be possible to use the same name, providing a snippet of
      that name does not already exist in the user database.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new snippet's category can be changed using the <em>Choose categegory
      for duplicate snippet</em> drop-down list. The category of the original
      snippet will already be selected, making it easy to create the new snippet
      in the same category.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>OK</em> to go ahead and create the new snippet. If the snippet
      name is invalid or is already in the user database an error will be
      displayed.
