      The Main Display
    </h1>
    <p>
      CodeSnip's display is divided into two main parts.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a
        href="overview_pane.htm"
      >Overview Pane</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is used to list all the snippets in the database. Snippets are
      organised by category, alphabetically or by <a
        href="snippet_kinds.htm"
      >snippet kind</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a
        href="detail_pane.htm"
      >Detail Pane</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Used to display detailed information about selected snippets and other
      items of information. Information is displayed in one or more tabs.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Other Elements
    </h2>
    <p>
      The window also contains a <a
        href="main_menu.htm"
      >main menu</a>, a toolbar and a status bar where database and search
      information and help text are displayed.
