      > Bug Report Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box is used to report bugs online. It is displayed by choosing
      the <em>Tools | Report Bug Online</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bugs are not reported directly from the dialog box. They are reported
      using the <em>CodeSnip</em> online bug tracker. At the time of writing the
      bug tracker is located on <em>SourceForge.net</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bug tracker is accessed by clicking the <em>Go to the Bug Tracker</em>
      link or by pressing <span class="smallcaps">Alt+B</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Using the Bug Tracker
    </h2>
    <p>
      The bug tracker displays a list of all reported bugs. You should first
      check the list to see if the bug has already been reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the bug has been reported check to see if has been fixed in a later
      version of <em>CodeSnip</em>, and if so, update your copy of the program.
      If the bug is still unfixed and you can provide additional information
      please leave a comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the bug has not been reported, please create a new bug report and
      provide as much information as you can. You should give steps to reproduce
      the bug if possible. You can also upload a screenshot or other file that
      helps to explain the bug.
