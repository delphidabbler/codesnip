# CodeSnip Pagoda

> **Branch abandoned**

Following a false start back in 2013/4 in the `parsnip` branch, development of CodeSnip 5 restarted in this `pagoda` branch, which picked up where `parsnip` left off. (Don't ask where those names came from!)

Unfortunately `pagoda` has also been abandoned now. The branch has been left in place in case anyone else wants to continue development.

The idea behind v5 was to:

1. Generalise CodeSnip to be a code bank for several different languages instead of just Pascal, while still providing some additional support for test-compiling Pascal code.
2. Increase the focus on the user's own code while downplaying the importance of code downloaded from the DelphiDabbler [Code Snippets database](http://snippets.delphidabbler.com/), like [SWAG](http://swag.delphidabbler.com/) is at present.<sup> †</sup>
3. Remove the program's dependency on web services provided by [DelphiDabbler.com](http://delphidabbler.com) given the current uncertainty over that websites future.

<sup>†</sup> It is hoped to move the Code Snippets database to GitHub before DelphiDabbler closes down on 15 June 2020.
