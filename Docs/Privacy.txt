PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR DELPHIDABBLER CODESNIP

================================================================================


Offline Privacy
================================================================================

CodeSnip stores some personal information in two configuration files:


Common.ini
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Common.ini is located in the %ProgramData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip folder.

The data that is stored in Common.ini is:

    * A unique 32 digit hexadecimal key based on attributes of your computer.
    * A 32 digit hexadecimal registration key (registered programs only).
    * The registered user name or nickname (registered programs only).

The data that is used to create the hexidecimal keys cannot be recovered from
the keys.


User.3.ini
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User.3.ini is found in the current user's %AppData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip
folder.

The file stores several user-specific application data settings such as your
preferences. The only personal information is as follows:

    * Any user name or email address you provided if you ever entered the
      information in a dialog box. This is used simply to automatically enter
      the data in dialog boxes where needed, to save you re-typing it. See below
      for details of activities that require either or both a name or email
      address to be submitted.

    * Your user name and password if you configured CodeSnip to access the
      internet using a proxy server. The information is used only to access the
      proxy. Passwords and encrypted.

If you have upgraded from CodeSnip v2 there may also be a file named User.ini.
This contains pretty much the same information as User.3.ini. The file is
ignored by CodeSnip v3.


Spyware
================================================================================

No spyware or other software that threatens your privacy has been deliberately
or knowingly included with CodeSnip. If the program is found to contain spyware
it will have been added by third parties and the author asks to be informed of
any such occurrence. Please report any suspicious behaviour via
www.delphidabbler.com/contact.

CodeSnip never tries to "phone home" of its own accord. It only goes online in
response to user requests. Should you notice any unauthorised activity please
inform the author since it is likely that your copy of the program has been
hacked by some third party.


CodeSnip Online Activity
================================================================================

Various user-initiated actions cause CodeSnip to go online. They are:

   1. Updating the database.
   2. Registering the program.
   3. Submitting code for inclusion in the main database.
   4. Displaying the latest news in the "CodeSnip News" dialog box.
   4. Accessing various websites via hyperlinks and menu options.
   5. Accessing the internet using a proxy server.

The first four actions are performed directly by CodeSnip, which communicates
with web services located at www.delphidabbler.com using HTTP on port 80. The
fifth action simply displays web pages in a browser. The sixth passes user
information to the proxy server.

Personal data will neither be published on the DelphiDabbler website nor
knowingly passed to third parties. Furthermore your data will only be used by
the author for the purposes described.


Updating the Database
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This activity is started by displaying the "Update From Web" dialog box and
clicking its "Update from Web" button. CodeSnip then contacts the update web
service and sends the following information:

    * Unique program key (see above for details).
    * Program version number.
    * Operating system description.
    * Internet Explorer version.

This information is recorded in two places:

   1. Each transaction is recorded in a log file on the web server. This log
      is used for tracking any database errors.

   2. A database of the program keys is updated with the following data:

        * the number of times that program has updated the database;
        * the first and latest version of CodeSnip having that program key;
        * the date of the first and latest updates;
        * the current operating system being used;
        * the current Internet Explorer version being used.

      This database is used to provide CodeSnip usage information and to track
      the operating systems and browser control versions currently in use. This
      information informs development of CodeSnip.

This information may be used to update the registered program database.

None of these records store any information that can be tracked back to an
individual.


Registering the Program
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This activity is started when the user chooses to register CodeSnip. A wizard
appears that guides the user through the registration process. The wizard
displays the data that is to be sent to the registration web service. The data
is only sent if the user clicks the wizard's "Submit" button. The data is:

    * The program's id, name and version information.
    * The unique program key (see above for details).
    * The user name or nickname.
    * A description of the operating system and version of Internet Explorer
      being used.

The registration data is recorded in a database on the DelphiDabbler web server.
The data is only used to keep track of the number of people using the different
versions of the program and what operating systems are being used. The
registration web service returns a registration code to the program. CodeSnip
records this code, with the user name, in Common.ini.

The registration information may be updated when the user updates the database
(see "Updating the Database" above).


Submitting code to the main database
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This activity is started from the "Database | Submit Snippets" menu option and
data is collected using the resulting wizard. Clicking the Submit button in the
wizard sends the following information to the DelphiDabbler code submission web
service:

    * The CodeSnip program version number.
    * Your name, email address any comments entered in the wizard.
    * All the routines you selected to send.

You can preview the data to be sent (in XML format) from the wizard. The XML
will be stored in a file on the DelphiDabbler server until processed. The data
is also emailed to the database maintainer (currently the author of CodeSnip).

The routines may be edited and published on the Code Snippets online database
and distributed to CodeSnip users. Your name may be used to credit the routines.
Your email address will not be published and is used only to contact you with
any queries about the submitted code.


Displaying the latest news
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This action is performed by selecting the "Help | CodeSnip News" menu option or
by clicking the "Latest News" button in the "Update from Web" dialog box.

CodeSnip simply requests an XML document containing an RSS 2.0 news feed from
the DelphiDabbler website using HTTP on port 80. No personal information is
included in the request.


Accessing Websites via Links and Menu Options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CodeSnip's "Help | On The Web" menu option leads to sub menu items that cause
various pages from DelphiDabbler.com to be displayed in the user's default
browser.

In addition, various links in the program's main display, some dialog boxes and
the help file access remote websites which are displayed in your default
browser. You should refer to the relevant website's privacy policies to learn
how they use any data you supply when visiting their pages. DelphiDabbler has no
control over the content of linked third party websites and you follow such
links at your own risk.


Accessing the internet using a proxy server
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CodeSnip can be configured to use a proxy server to access the internet. In this
case the program sends the appropriate user name and password to the proxy
server if required. DelphiDabbler has no control over the proxy server and you
should satisfy yourself that the proxy you use is trustworthy. You use this
feature at your own risk.
