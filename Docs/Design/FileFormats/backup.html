<h1>
  Backup Files
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  The CodeSnip backup file format is a general format that can store all the
  files from a single directory, excluding sub-directories. It preserves file
  dates and contents.
</p>

<p>
  CodeSnip stores backups of both the main and user databases using this format.
</p>

<p>
  A backup file is a single file containing a concatenation of all the backed up
  files, along with some header and housekeeping information. Quite how the data
  is stored and organised has varied over time. There have been four versions of
  the file format to date:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Version 1
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This first version of the file was used only to back up the user database in
    a single text file. All housekeeping information and meta data was stored as
    encoded text. The file size was limited to 32Kb. Only text files could be
    stored in this format.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Version 2
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Similar to version 1 except that the 32Kb size limit was lifted (now 2Gb).
    Used only for backing up the user database.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Version 3
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Similar to Versions 1 and 2. Now used for backing up both the user database
    and the main database. A file ID field was added to specify which database
    was backed up. The file ID generalises to any file.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Version 4
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Major changes in this version. The contents of the file are now binary
    rather than text. Any file type can now be included in the backup. Maintains
    the FileID from Version 3. Also has an ASCII text watermark to enable
    earlier readers to detect it.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>
  Encoding
</h2>

<p>
  The following encodings have been used for backup files:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Versions 1 and 2
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The entire backup file is in the System Default ANSI code page. All backed
    up files are expected to be text files with the same encoding. Meta data and
    housekeeping data is stored as hex representation of integers. Note that hex
    characters are the same in this code page as they are in the ASCII character
    set.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Version 3
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Up to and including CodeSnip 3.5.0 backup files used the same System Default
    ANSI code page as versions 1 and 2. From CodeSnip 3.5.1 the code page was
    changed to Windows-1252. Again hex characters are the same as they are in
    the ASCII character set.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Version 4
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This file format uses pure binary raw data. The watermark part of the file
    header is written in ASCII. File names are stored as UTF-8. All other
    information is stored as raw binary.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  File formats v1 to v3 required that hex characters were written using a single
  byte, ruling out the use of Unicode formats such as UTF-16.
</p>

<h2>
  File Reading &amp; Writing Notes
</h2>

<p>
  Code that writes backup files should only ever write the latest available file
  format at the time the code was written. It musr never attempt to write
  earlier versions.
</p>

<p>
  Code that restores backup files must be able to interpret all earlier formats in
  addition to the current one, because the program may need to restore data from an
  old backup file. If the code detects a later version than it was designed for
  it should display an error message and terminate.
</p>

<h3>
  Problems with Earlier Backup Restoration Code
</h3>

<p>
  Some earlier versions of the backup restoration code have faults in that they
  will attempt to read later backup file versions than those they were designed
  for. By good fortune, factors in the design of later file formats mean that the
  reading code always abandons reading later, albeit with no error message. These
  problems are:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    File readers designed to work with file format v1
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <div class="half-spaced">
      At this time there was no concept there would be different versions of the
      backup file format, so the code does not attempt to detect the file
      version.
    </div>
    <div class="half-spaced">
      The reading code expects backup files to begin with a file count as a text
      representation of a SmallInt in hex. In file version 2 and later the first
      four ANSI chars of the file are <code>'FFFF'</code>, which decodes as
      <code>-1</code>. The reader interprets this value as meaning there are no
      files in the backup and does nothing.
    </div>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    File readers designed to work with file format v2
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <div class="half-spaced">
      These readers interpret the v1 and v2 file formats correctly.
    </div>
    <div class="half-spaced">
      In v3 files the file ID is recorded in the same location and same format
      as the v2 file format expects to find the file count. Luckily the only two
      values in use as File IDs are <code>'CBAC'</code> and <code>'DBAC'</code>,
      both of which decode as negative integers expressed in hex. The reader software interprets
      this as meaning there are no files in the backup.
    </div>
    <div class="helf-speed">
      The v4 file format moved the file ID value to a new location and replaced
      it with a padding value of <code>'0000'</code> in the v2 file count
      location, again indicating there are no files in the backup to v2 file
      format readers.
    </div>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    File readers designed to work with file format v3
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <div class="half-spaced">
      These readers interpret the v1, v2 and v3 file formats correctly.
    </div>
    <div class="half-spaced">
      Up to, and including, CodeSnip v3.8.5, file reader software designed to
      work with file format v3 will also try to read later file versions. It
      looks for its file count in a hex encoded SmallInt value at position 12 in
      the backup file. File format v4 was designed to have a padding value of
      <code>'0000'</code> in this location. This fools the v3 reader software
      into thinking there are no files in the backup.
    </div>
    <div class="half-spaced">
      From CodeSnip v3.8.6 the file reader works correctly and exits with an error when an unsupported backup file version is encountered.
    </div>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  The file reader designed to work with the v4 file format does recognise newer
  versions of the file format and <em>does not</em> try to read them. Instead it
  raises an exception.
</p>

<p>
  In summary, all future backup files should begin with these ANSI / ASCII
  characters: <code>'FFFFxxxx00000000'</code> where xxxx is the file version
  number as a SmallInt encoded as four hex characters. For example for file
  format v4 we use <code>'FFFF000400000000'</code>.
</p>

<h3>
  Identification of file format versions
</h3>

<p>
  Each file version can be considered to have a unique "watermark" at the start
  of the file if we consider an empty watermark to be valid. This is fine as
  long as only one file version has the empty watermark. Here are the current
  watermarks as strings of ASCII characters:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    File format version 1
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Watermark: <code>''</code> (empty)
  </dd>
  <dt>
    File format version 2
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Watermark: <code>'FFFF0002'</code>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    File format version 3
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Watermark: <code>'FFFF0003'</code>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    File format version 4
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Watermark: <code>'FFFF000400000000'</code>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  It can be seen that the version number at byte offset 4 is not necessary for
  identification if the watermark is made longer. However, it should always be
  used because earlier versions of the file readers may use it to determine which
  format version is to be read.
