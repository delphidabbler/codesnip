<h1>
  Main Database Files
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  The Code Snippets database is stored in a set of .ini files with associated
  data files located in the main database directory. Two subsidiary text files
  containing credits are also included.
</p>

<p>
  The master data file is named <code>categories.ini</code>. This lists the
  database categories. There is another .ini file for each category which stores
  information about all the snippets in the category.
</p>

<p>
  The source code for each snippet is stored in separate data files &ndash; one
  or more per snippet. This snippet file is referenced in the relevant category
  .ini file.
</p>

<p>
  The credits text files contain lists of names.
</p>

<h2>
  Encoding
</h2>

<p>
  CodeSnip v4 stores all main database files, including the subsidiary text
  files, using UTF-8 encoding. Files are saved with the UTF-8 preamble (BOM).
</p>

<p>
  Prior to CodeSnip v4 local database files were encoded using the system
  default ANSI code page.
</p>

<p>
  CodeSnip v4 must be able to work with both encodings because it may inherit or
  have to use a database downloaded by a v3 or earlier version of the program.
</p>

<h2>
  File Format
</h2>

<h3>
  Master Data File
</h3>

<p>
  This file has a simple format. Each section is named after a category id, i.e.
  the id by which the category is referred to in the database. Each section of
  the .ini file has a value containing the description of the category and
  another that names the category's .ini file. Here is the format of a
  section:
</p>

<pre class="indent">[cat-id]
Desc=Category description
Ini=ini-file-name</pre>

<p>
  and here is an example (this is a copy of the &quot;Date and Time&quot;
  category's entry):
</p>

<pre class="indent">[date]
Desc=Date and Time
Ini=date.ini</pre>

<h3>
  Category ini files
</h3>

<p>
  Each section in these files defines a snippet and has the following content:
</p>

<pre class="indent">[snippet-name]

<p>
  The sections in these files are named with a unique name that identifies a
  snippet. This must be a valid Unicode Pascal identifier. The values have the
  following purpose:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <em>DisplayName</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <div class="half-spaced">
      Display name of snippet. If present this value is used in the program GUI
      as the snippet's name. The value is optional. If not present the name of
      the section is used as the display name. There are no restriction on the
      characters used.
    </div>
    <div class="half-spaced">
      Supported from CodeSnip v4.0 beta 1 and ignored by earlier versions which
      always use the section name as display name.
    </div>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>Desc</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Description of the snippet as plain text. Ignored by versions of CodeSnip
    that recognise <em>DescEx</em> if that field is present.

<p>
  Each value should occur only once. If more than one value of the same type is
  present the result is not defined and may change between program versions.
</p>

<h4>
  Pre-processor directives
</h4>

<p>
  A simple pre-processor was added to CodeSnip v3 and later that can process
  special pre-processor instructions contained in .ini files. The pre-processor
  symbols are ignored by CodeSnip versions earlier than v3. These symbols allow
  the program's version number to be tested and different parts of the file to
  be read or ignored accordingly.
</p>

<p>
  Pre-processor instructions all begin with &quot;;&quot;, the .ini file comment
  character, followed by a &quot;#&quot; and then the instruction name. Valid
  instructions are:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <em>if-ver-eq &lt;version&gt;</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Checks if application version is equal to &lt;version&gt;.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>if-ver-neq &lt;version&gt;</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Checks if application version is not equal to &lt;version&gt;.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>if-ver-lt &lt;version&gt;</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Checks if application version is less than &lt;version&gt;.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <del><em>if-ver-lte &lt;version&gt;</em></del>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <del>Checks if application version is less than or equal to
    &lt;version&gt;.</del> &dagger;
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>if-ver-gt &lt;version&gt;</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Checks if application version is greater than &lt;version&gt;.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <del><em>if-ver-gte &lt;version&gt;</em></del>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <del>Checks if application version is greater than or equal to
    &lt;version&gt;.</del> &dagger;
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>if-ver-inrange &lt;version-lo&gt; &lt;version-hi&gt;</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Checks if application version is in the range of versions specified from
    &lt;version-lo&gt; to &lt;version-hi&gt;, inclusive.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>end-if</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Ends a block started by any of the if-xxx instructions above. The block of
    text is only evaluated if the if-xxx instruction evaluates true.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  &dagger; Due to a bug going back to <em>CodeSnip</em> v3.0 <em>if-ver-gte</em>
  and <em>if-ver-lte</em> have never worked correctly: they have always been
  interpreted as <em>if-ver-gt</em> and <em>if-ver-lt</em> respectively. A fix
  to this could now cause more problems than it solves in older version of
  <em>CodeSnip</em>, so the implementation of the problematic directives has
  been removed from later versions of the program and all occurrences of the
  directives in the database have been replaced by suitable
  <em>if-ver-inrange</em> directives.
</p>

<p>
  In all cases version numbers are dotted quads of the form X.X.X.X where X is
  a sequence of digits. All except the first digit can be left out: omitted
  digits are assumed to be zero, so that 1.0.0.0, 1.0.0, 1.0 and 1 are all
  equivalent.
</p>

<p>
  <em>if-ver-lt 3</em> can be used to ignore a whole snippet definition in a
  normal .ini file, leaving the possibility of having a duplicate definition for
  CodeSnip v3 or later stored in a matching .3.ini file. E.g.
</p>

<p>
  <code>date.ini</code>:
</p>

<pre class="indent">
;#if-ver-lt 3
[Snippet1]
Desc=&quot;My description&quot;
Snip=044.dat
...
;#end-if</pre>

<p>
  <code>date.3.ini</code>:
</p>

<pre class="indent">[Snippet1]
Desc=&quot;My second description&quot;
Snip=044.3.dat
...</pre>

<h4>
  Additional .ini Files For CodeSnip v3 and v4
</h4>

<p>
  From CodeSnip v3 additional .ini files with .3 interposed between the file
  name and extension are supported (e.g. <code>category.3.ini</code> and
  <code>date.3.ini</code> are valid names).
</p>

<p>
  From v4 similar files using the interposed .4 extension are supported in
  addition to the .3 files (e.g <code>winsys.4.ini</code>).
</p>

<p>
  CodeSnip concatenates all .ini files with the same base name before analysing
  the file. For example if <code>date.ini</code>, <code>date.3.ini</code> and
  <code>date.4.ini</code> all exist then <code>date.3.ini</code> and
  <code>date.4.ini</code> are appended to <code>date.ini</code> before the files
  are analysed.
</p>

<p>
  The .3 &quot;inner&quot; extension was provided for category files so that
  constant and type definition snippets could be hidden from CodeSnip versions
  below v3 but be visible to CodeSnip v3 and later. The new style constant and
  type definition snippets are only recorded in .3 style files.
</p>

<p>
  <code>categories.3.ini</code> has been provided to add any sections that need
  to be hidden from CodeSnip versions before v3. The &quot;types&quot; and
  &quot;consts&quot; sections are recorded in this file.
</p>

<p>
  .4 &quot;inner&quot; extensions are there to support any CodeSnip v4 specific
  features that can't be hidden from earlier versions.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, it is possible that a <code>name.3.ini</code> or
  <code>name.4.ini</code> file will exist with no matching
  <code>name.ini</code>. In this case <code>categories.ini</code> (or
  <code>categories.3.ini</code>) must still refer to <code>name.ini</code>, not
  <code>name.3.ini</code> or <code>name.4.ini</code>. The program works out
  which files to load.
</p>

<h3>
  Source Code Files
</h3>

<p>
  Source code is stored separately from the category .ini files. Each snippet
  has its own uniquely named file. Files can have any name providing it doesn't
  clash with the master file name or the names of the category files. By
  convention, source code files are named numerically in sequence and have a
  .dat file extension. So <code>102.dat</code> is a typical source code file
  name. Sometimes there is a separate file for later versions of CodeSnip, so
  an occasional file named, for example, <code>102.3.dat</code> may be found.
</p>

<p>
  Source code files are referenced by the <em>Snip</em> field in category .ini
  files.
</p>

<h3>
  Subsidiary &quot;Credits&quot; Text Files
</h3>

<p>
  There are two credits files, <code>contrib.txt</code> and
  <code>testers.txt</code> that list the people who have contributed code to the
  main database or helped to test the code, respectively.
</p>

<p>
  Each file is simply a list of names, each name on a separate line.
</p>

<p>
  The credits files stand alone from the other files in the database in that
  they are not referenced by, and do not reference, any of the other files.
